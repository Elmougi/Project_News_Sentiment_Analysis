BBC,en,world,"Typhoon Fung-wong, with sustained winds of 185 km/h (115mph), hit the Philippines as a super typhoon and later weakened. Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died. The storm hit as a super typhoon, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). By 02:00, the storm weakened to a typhoon and was over La Union in western Luzon. The country's meteorological service warned of destructive winds and ""high-risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left  nearly 200 people dead. Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning. The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon. The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon. More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides. In the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang. He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning. While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind. In central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. ""We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,"" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC. Another evacuee Patry Azul said: ""Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe."" Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year. Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. The Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm. It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services. For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come. ""We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,"" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency. He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon. Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: ""I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge."" The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Are you in the Philippines? If so you cancontact us here"

BBC,en,world,"The government is pleading with Iranians to save water as reservoirs dry up and rainfall is at a record low. Iran - especially its capital, Tehran - is facing an unprecedented drought this autumn, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens. President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster. ""If rationing doesn't work,"" Pezeshkian said, ""we may have to evacuate Tehran."" His comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea ""a joke"" and said ""evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all"". Iran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days. Meanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital. ""I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,"" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian. In the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen faucet with no running water. ""It's been four or five hours,"" he said. ""I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet."" The manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition. ""I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,"" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV. According to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically. ""We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,"" he said. ""We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'"" The government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies. ""Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,"" he said. Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water. Iran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel. During that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June.Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area. The day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military ""command centres"". But the crisis extends far beyond the capital. The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a ""worrying state"", with water levels in the single-digit percentages. In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well. The Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to ""less than eight percent,"" warning that the province faces a ""mega-challenge of drought."" CEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower. ""The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,"" Hossein Esmaeilian said. ""Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation."" Iran's water crisis has been decades in the making. Even Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly acknowledged the looming threat — speaking about water shortages in his Nowruz addresses in 2011 and on other occasions in the following years. Yet little has changed. Today, Tehran, Karaj and Mashhad — home to more than 16 million people combined — are facing the real possibility of their taps running dry."
BBC,en,world,"The Israeli military confirmed the soldier's body had been returned from Gaza after 11 years on Sunday. Israel has received the body of Lt Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in an ambush by Hamas in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then. The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée. Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal. Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal. On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: ""Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said ""we didn't give up"" on bringing him home. ""I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel."" Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin ""involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground"" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The military expressed ""deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement"". Herzog said the government would ""continue to act tirelessly"" to bring home all the hostages. Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai. Lt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters. The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead. Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable. During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal. On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an ""immediate threat"". Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said. Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis. Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry."
BBC,en,world,"US lawmakers are working over the weekend as they seek a bipartisan deal to end the shutdown, which is now on day 40. Flight delays and cancellations continue to snarl US air travel for a third day as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned air traffic will be ""reduced to a trickle"" if the US government shutdown continues. More than 2,900 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled and8,600delayed by late afternoon on Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The longest delays were reported in Newark, New Jersey – more than two hours on average. In a hopeful sign, lawmakers are working on a possible deal to reach a compromise on government funding and end the shutdown, according to US media reports. The Senate was scheduled to convene on Sunday in a rare weekend session. Duffy warned the impacts on air travel will grow dire if they do not break the stalemate soon. ""You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,"" he said on CNN on Sunday. He added that travellers trying to fly home for the Thanksgiving holiday later this month may not be able to get there. ""Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,"" he said. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced last week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to 6% this weekend and 10% by next weekend at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. The cuts do not apply to international flights, but some airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, the FAA said. Air traffic controllers, who are not being paid during the shutdown, are reportedly fatigued and not coming to work, triggering the reductions in air traffic allowances. Duffy said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered to have military air traffic controllers step in to help but he declined the offer because they are not certified to direct air traffic at the civilian airports. Altogether, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not being paid since the Government ran out of money on 1 October. Food assistance for low-income Americans also has been in limbo, with the administration agreeing to pay only half of monthly benefits. Sunday marked the 40th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government. The two parties have blamed each other for causing the impasse and for the travel disruptions. The White House said on Friday that Democrats were ""inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving"". Meanwhile, on Saturday Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of ""playing games with people's livelihoods"". Democrats have refused to back any Republican spending plan unless money for health insurance subsidies be included, while Republicans want to provide funding for the government without anything else attached. US President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend money should be sent directly to Americans to buy health insurance rather than to insurance companies. Republican senators are working on a compromise package that could end the impasse with a vote to advance legislation possibly coming on Sunday."
BBC,en,world,"Emergency services have warned tourists and locals to keep away from coastal paths due to rough sea conditions. Three people died and 15 more were injured after powerful waves battered popular Spanish holiday island Tenerife. A woman died after being pulled into the ocean near the the Puerto de la Cruz resort and a man died at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emergency services said on Sunday. A third man was found dead in the ocean near a beach in Granadilla. Emergency services have told the public to stay away from coastal paths and to avoid taking pictures and videos of the rough seas, as the turbulent weather continues. Rescue services said they airlifted a man who fell into water at La Guancha in the north of the island, but that he was later pronounced dead at hospital. They said another man died after he was found floating near a beach at El Cabezo in the south, with lifeguards and medical staff unable to resuscitate him. At Puerto de la Cruz, a holiday resort in northern Tenerife, one woman died of a heart attack and another 10 people were swept out to sea. Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital. A local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out. ""As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,"" he said. Eyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but ""they did not pay attention"". Officials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards. They warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise ""extreme caution""."
BBC,en,world,"Sir Richard Knighton, the UK military chief, says his Belgian counterpart requested assistance in the form of personnel and equipment this week. Britain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said. Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way. Brussels Airportwas forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base. It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting ""hybrid warfare"" on allies of Ukraine. Sir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was ""plausible"" they had been ordered by Moscow. Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: ""As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace"". Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands. Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium ""by providing our kit and capability"". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels. About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced ""considerable costs"" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this. ""At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,"" Francken said earlier this week. ""Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries."" Sir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, ""the most pressing threat right now"" to Europe. ""The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts."" He added thatsabotageandkillingshad been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which ""we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves"". Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014. Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato. The shadow defence secretary welcomed the decision to assist Belgium, saying there was ""a heightened threat environment"" and that a key part of deterring threats was ""by acting with other countries through Nato"". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed. In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was ""more than I've ever known in my career"". The incursion into Belgian airspace follows similar incursions across European nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. All are Nato allies that have provided support to Ukraine. While some have pointed the finger at Russia, officials have not produced evidence linking the incursions to Moscow, while the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement. Suspicions have been fuelled bymore overt airspace incursionsby Russia in Eastern Europe in recent months, involvingfighter jetsand larger attack drones. Mocow has denied these were intentional. The UK has recently sentRAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missionsover Poland as part of Nato'smission to bolster the eastern flankin response to incursions. Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to EU-wide discussions touse frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainein the form of a €140bn loan."
BBC,en,world,"The mystery youth in the photo turns out to be Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old detective fan. In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the ""fedora man"" was. The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity. Policemoved swiftlyto arrest and charge four people for the crime, while theLouvre director admittedCCTV security was inadequate. However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now. The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene. Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. ""We didn't know there was a heist,"" he said. As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame. Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: ""Is that you?"" When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. ""I was a bit surprised,"" Pedro told the AP. He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and ""it's not every day you're in the New York Times"". ""People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days."" Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives. ""I like to be chic,"" he told the AP. ""I go to school like this."" As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks. ""I didn't want to say immediately it was me,"" he said. ""With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last."""
BBC,en,world,"The museum authority has cancelled all preview events leading up to Tuesday's grand opening. Protesters targeted a new multi-million dollar museum in Nigeria and forced organisers to halt a preview event ahead of Tuesday's grand opening. Videos showed a group insulting foreign guests and ordering them to leave after entering the grounds of the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City on Sunday. The museum in Edo state was in part conceived as a home for the Benin Bronzes - artefacts looted from there by British soldiers in the 19th Century. The campus includes state-of-the art preservation and restoration facilities. However, a bitter dispute over the control of the prized artworks has meant they are not at the museum, something that appeared to have angered the protesters. All guests were safely escorted to secure locations,according to a statement from the museum. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused,"" Mowaa said. A local resident told the BBC the frustration stems from what many see as a hijacking of an Edo project. ""The Benin Oba [king], traditional rulers and the government of Edo are not happy about it,"" the resident added. ""Edo"" was initially in the museum's name, but this was later dropped. Executive director Phillip Ihenacho told the BBC the backers wanted the institution to serve a wider purpose beyond Nigeria. In its statement, Mowaa said the protest ""appeared to stem from disputes between the previous and current state administrations"". The museum emphasised it was an independent, non-profit organisation and, though a former state governor had backed the project, he had no interest in it ""financial or otherwise"". Mowaa has now cancelled all preview events leading up to the opening and advised visitors to avoid the campus until the situation is resolved. ""We are deeply grateful to all our guests - many of whom travelled long distances to be here - for their understanding, patience and resilience,"" the statement said.

BBC,en,world,"A manhunt is under way for the 68-year-old's killer and other suspects who were at the scene in Tema. A British man has died after being shot during a robbery in Ghana on Friday, police say. Ashraf Qarmar Parvez, 68, was shot after he tried to stop an attempt to steal his phone at a drinking spot in Tema, a city to the east of the Ghanaian capital, Accra. He later died in hospital, police said. Authorities in Ghana are searching for the shooter - one of a group of six suspects who they say were at the scene and fled on motorbikes. The UK Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a man who had died. A 9mm spent bullet shell was recovered from the shooting site and police have interviewed witnesses as part of their investigation. The incident has raised security concerns in the industrial city of Tema, but a local police spokesperson told the BBC that the shooting was a rare incident."
BBC,en,business,"The tax body had used travel data to conclude that thousands of parents had left the country permanently but many say they just went on holiday. The UK's tax body is reviewing its decisions to strip child benefit from about 23,500 claimants after it used travel data to conclude they had left the country permanently. Normally the benefit runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK, but many people affected complained that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time. The move came after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee demanded answers from the tax authority. HMRC has apologised for any errors and says anyone who thinks their benefits have been stopped incorrectly should contact them. A government spokesperson said: ""We're very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. ""We have taken immediate action to update the process, giving customers one month to respond before payments are suspended. We remain committed to protecting taxpayers' money and are confident that the majority of suspensions are accurate."" In September, the government began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over five years. The new system allows HMRC records to be compared with Home Office international travel data, and the tax authority had used this data to stop payments to thousands of families. But it is now reviewing all of the cases following a growing number of complaints from people affected who said they had been on holiday, and had returned to the UK after a short time. Eve Craven went on a five-day break with her son to New York. She toldthe BBC's Money Box programmethat about 18 months after the trip she received a letter saying the child benefit for her son had been stopped. The letter cited her trip to the US, saying it had no record of her return. ""It gave me a month basically to give them all the requested information to prove that I'd come back to the UK,"" she said. ""It's just a very big ask for something that they've messed up on, and they should have been able to sort out themselves."" Eve's child benefit has now been reinstated with missing payments backdated. The issue was first identified in Northern Ireland, where some families had flown out of the UK from Belfast, but then returned to Dublin – which is in the EU - before driving home over the border. UK and Irish citizens can travel freely into each other's countries under the Common Travel Area arrangement. There are no routine passport checks when travelling through the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, meaning the UK government has no data to show that someone may have returned to Northern Ireland. It is not clear how many errors have been made in total, or how. HMRC told Money Box it would be reviewing all past cases ""using PAYE data and where continued UK employment is found, will be reinstating payments and making any back payments necessary"". It is aiming to complete its review by the end of next week. MPs on the Treasury Select Committee are also now investigating. Additional reporting by Nick Edser"
BBC,en,business,"The block on exports of the company's chips had raised fears that European car production would be hit. China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry has said. Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods. In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this monthit would begin easing the banas part of a trade deal struck between the US and China. While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted. Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"". Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business. But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovicannounced in a post on Xthat China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"". ""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows."" In its statement, China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible."""
BBC,en,business,"The advert seeks ""an extraordinary tutor"" required ""to support child on his first steps to becoming an English gentleman."" ""A family based in north London seeks an extraordinary and experienced tutor to support their youngest child on his first steps to becoming an English gentleman."" When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first-steps"", as a turn of phrase. But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old. Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why? Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"". When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak"". He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. The plan:To bring in a British tutor, who must speak with Received Pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. ""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"". ""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests. More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. ""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway? ""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns. Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, who also offer private tutors, wrotein a blogthat ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered."" Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. ""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman onto a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote. ""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire. ""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son."" He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within."" Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. ""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said. ""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said. ""I think we should be proud of it. The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"". ""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. But she also teaches groups of children too. Why? ""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. ""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities."" She said she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person."" Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits. ""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are. ""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. Raising children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for parent Daniel (not his real name). ""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straight-jacket of that,"" he said. Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by Artificial Intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor. The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London,Latymer Upper School,has now dropped using most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning. ""If GCSE's aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" said Daniel. ""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school feesincreased following the addition of VAT in January, he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. ""My kids could have one-twentieth of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no brainer.""

BBC,en,business,"Once found by the roadside offering local produce for a few pence, honesty boxes are being reborn via social media. Honesty boxes: traditionally found on rural lay-bys, offering local produce like eggs and apples in exchange for a small donation. With cash use falling, they might be expected to disappear - a roadside relic as we all pull onto the technology superhighway. But, in fact, many are flourishing. Cash payments are being replaced with online transfers via QR codes, and small traders are using honesty boxes as part of their marketing on social media. That online marketing has a payoff. Some are finding that instead of just attracting passing trade, customers are making a special journey to buy from them. On the side of an A-road between Canterbury and the north Kent coast is a small but colourful honesty box."
BBC,en,business,"Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the investigation, with conclusions set to be published next summer. An independent review into the rising number of young people not working or studying is being launched by the government. Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the inquiry into ""Neets"" - the acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training. According to Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden, the persistently high number of 16-24 year olds falling out of education or work is a ""crisis of opportunity"" requiring urgent action. It is not a new problem but the number of young people who are Neet - now one in eight - has been rising in recent years and is approaching one million. A quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier and the number claiming health and disability benefits is rising too. The government says Alan Milburn's review will dig into the reasons behind the rise and examine ways of cutting the long-term costs of youth inactivity and getting young people off benefits and into work. Its conclusions will be published next summer. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the broader benefits system unsustainable and unfair but so far selling welfare reform to Labour backbenchers has proved a political minefield for Number 10. According to the Department of Work and Pensions, the number of young people claiming Universal Credit (UC) Health and Employment Support Allowance has risen by more than 50% over the past five years. Some 80% of young people on the UC Health element currently cite mental health reasons or a neurodevelopmental condition. Asked whether he thought over-diagnosis was fuelling a mental health crisis among young people, McFadden wasquoted by the Sunday Timesas saying: ""I don't want to play amateur doctor. I want to approach this with sensitivity. ""The question I'm asking is, given the higher reported number of these conditions among young people, what is the best policy response? I don't believe there should be an automatic link between diagnosis and benefits."" ""If we get this right,"" he added, ""the prize is huge: transforming lives and life chances, with the pent-up potential of the next generation firing our economy and building a better future for all. ""We cannot afford to lose a generation of young people to a life on benefits, with no work prospects and not enough hope."" Milburn said his review would be ""uncompromising"", and expose any failings in employment support, education, skills, health and welfare. ""We cannot stand by and let a generation of young people be consigned to a life without employment or prospects,"" he said. ""It's clear urgent action is needed."""
BBC,en,business,"As the two nations vie for key materials, the US has regained the lead in foreign direct investments in African countries. You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been thebiggest playerin the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa,according to the latest annual figures.The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of""countering China's presence in strategic regions"". What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metalssecured a $3.9m grantfrom the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haimambo is an economist at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haimambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa isconstructing the refineryin South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haimambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
BBC,en,business,"Thousands more flights have been delayed or cancelled as the reduction of air travel capacity continues during the federal government shutdown. More than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown. Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue. Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history. Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at resolving the deadlock. Republicans have rejected an offer by Democrats to pass the current funding bill, in exchange for a one-year extension to health care subsidies. The shutdown is beginning to be felt by more and more Americansamid cuts to food aid paymentsand the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged party leaders ""to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown"". New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 90 minutes, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Flights to John F Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York were delayed by nearly three hours and an hour respectively, the FAA reported on Saturday afternoon. Other airports affected by lengthy delays inncluded Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Saturday post on X. ""We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports - instead having private jets utilise smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,"" Duffy wrote. ""That's only fair."" And things are likely to get worse in the coming days as the FAA cancels more flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November. The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called in sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. The controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown. Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place. During the last government shutdown, under the first Trump administration in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work while they weren't receiving a paycheque."
BBC,en,business,"Shareholders have approved a pay package that puts an astronomical value on Elon Musk's value as a leader. A great leader is a huge asset for a company, of course, but can anyone be worth $1 trillion? That is the pay packet Tesla shareholders have approved for Elon Musk, as long as he meets the targets they have set over the next 10 years. In the meantime he won't collect a salary, but will presumably throw himself into his work with renewed vigour. He was certainly buzzing with energy as he jigged around the stage at the carmaker's Texas headquarters to rapturous applause, telling the audience that while other shareholder meetings were ""snoozefests"", Tesla's are ""bangers"". Musk has attracted an army of critics, upset that he sided with US President Donald Trump, wielding his chainsaw at government programmes, and wading into politics overseas with explicit support for the far right. But he has an equally large following of admirers, people who believe in his vision and don't doubt that he can achieve it. It seems most of his shareholders are in this camp, afterthey backed his new remuneration package this week. Of course shareholders signed up, says New York-based financial analyst Dan Ives. If Musk succeeds - and Ives thinks he will - he will have created trillions of dollars worth of shareholder value, ample payback for investors. Ives sees Musk as a ""modern day Albert Einstein, a Thomas Edison"". Without the stupendous pay package, he says, there was a risk that within a few years Musk would have walked away, taking his Artificial Intellgience (AI) initiatives with him. ""Tesla without Musk is like pizza without cheese,"" he says. Ives does not own shares in Tesla, but analyses the company for his firm Wedbush Securities and thinks Musk's ""ability to go where others are not"" means he may well achieve the targets that have been set. ""There's edgy behaviour, there's haters, but a lot of people love that. And that's why he's the richest person in the world. ""Does it help sell cars in Europe? No. But does it help Tesla win the AI race? Yes."" Musk's political activities have prompted a backlash from some customers, including demonstrations outside showrooms earlier this year. But Matt Britzman at Hargreaves Lansdown in London, who has invested in Tesla, says the impact is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Tesla's earnings. Far from weighing on the firm's valuation, he reckons around a third of the value of Tesla can be attributed to what he calls the ""Musk premium"", value that wouldn't be there without him. ""It's a $1.4 trillion company, not based on the current car business. It's a $1.4 trillion business based on expectations of what it can deliver over the next three years."" And a lot of those expectations are fixed on Musk and his record of thinking big and thinking long term, he says. The potential reward for Musk is as astronomical as his vision for space travel. With $1 trillion you could buy 20 million Model Y Teslas, at around $50,000 each. Or you could buy yourself a $10m house every day for 250 years, and still have change for furnishing and decorating. The conditions appear to be very testing, including delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots. A million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles will also need to be on the roads. Tesla's overall market value will need to rise from its current $1.4tn to $8.5tn. These are ""incredibly high milestones"", says Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. However, the board does have ""discretion"" to decide when some of them have been met, she adds. ""If intervening events prevent him from reaching the goals, the board can deem them met anyway."" So the targets may not turn out to be quite as demanding as they appear. There is also nothing in the terms, no constraint, that prevents Musk continuing to speak out about politics or anything else. ""Even after the pay package was proposed, he didn't pull back from his political commentary,"" adds Prof Lipton. ""So it seems to me that this pay package, whatever the goals are, however lofty they may be, they're not going to inhibit him from involving himself in whatever matters he wants to be involved in."" That freedom could pose the biggest risk, according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. Musk is a visionary she says, but he's also unpredictable, and it is possible that his other interests may distract him as they have before, leading him to neglect Tesla, which itself is already a smorgasbord of different businesses and challenges. ""I'm hoping that based on his experience with getting politically involved and how that really hurt some of his brand and sales that he has learned to really focus on this business. ""But that's going to be the board's responsibility,"" she adds, ""to make sure that he stays within the guardrails, and that he does what's right for Tesla."" And if he does, well the sky is the limit, or possibly Mars, for Musk's ambition. ""People laughed when his 2018 pay package was approved,"" says Prof Lipton. ""And he hit those milestones well ahead of schedule."""
BBC,en,business,"We look at the Christmas ads that are out so far - and what they tell us about the year that’s been. It's still only early November, but Christmas adverts are already coming thick and fast. While they feature the usual sprinkle of festive cheer, experts say this year’s ads have also been tapping into some of 2025’s biggest themes, from the cost of living to masculinity. The idea of hardworking families trying to get by is at the centre of Asda’s advert, which depicts the Grinch trying to do his Christmas shopping. Meanwhile, John Lewis’s festive advert explores masculinity and emotion, leading some analysts to suggest it has undertones ofone the year's biggest TV shows, Netflix drama Adolescence. “What's striking this year is how the Christmas adverts are letting real life in,” said retail expert Kate Hardcastle. TV historian Dr Richard Wallace adds that if retailers can find a way to “incorporate a topical social issue in a careful way”, it can lead to an advert “really cutting through”. The BBC has looked at the Christmas adverts that are out so far - and asked experts what they tell us about the past year. The John Lewis Christmas advert - seen by many as marking the start of the festive season - was beamed into our homes on Tuesday. Set to Alison Limerick's 1990s track Where Love Lives, reimagined by British artist Labrinth, it's the first time the retailer has centred an ad around a father-son relationship. The ad depicts a teenage boy, who struggles to express his emotions for his dad, using music as a way to connect with him. We see the dad discovering an unopened Christmas present with his name on it - a vinyl record of Where Love Lives - which he immediately puts on. As the song fills the room, he's transported back to a 90s club, dancing with his friends, before seeing flashbacks of his son as a baby. When we return to the present day, the teenage son and dad share a slightly embarrassed hug and laugh together. Reacting to the ad, retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth said it has ""Adolescence written all over it"". ""Especially with its focus on the lack of communication between father and son,"" she told BBC News. Dr Wallace agreed, saying the advert had given a classic Christmas message of togetherness ""a 2025 twist"". ""There is clearly a desire to incorporate topical issues into this year's adverts,"" he said. ""John Lewis has responded to the crisis of masculinity, so evocatively addressed in one of this year's standout TV dramas Adolescence, to make a touching piece that speaks to the challenges of navigating inter-generational male relationships."" John Lewis's director of brand Rosie Hanley told BBC News that the script had been planned in January, before Adolescence came out. But the drama's huge success ""gave us reassurance that we were telling a story that was really relevant in 2025,"" she said. Other retailers appear to have nodded to the cost of living. The Asda advert, set to the song Let it Snow, follows The Grinch reluctantly doing his festive shop. But the green cynic changes his tune once he's wowed by some of the low price products on offer. For Dr Wallace, the ad sends a message that ""an affordable Christmas"" is possible, by ""placating the cash-strapped 'Grinch' that threatens to spoil everyone's Christmas"". This message is echoed in Lidl's Christmas advert, which focuses on generosity and small acts of kindness rather than abundance and excess. The ad also has a real-world action point, by pointing viewers towards Lidl's Toy Bank scheme. According to Lidl, the nationwide scheme has seen over 250,000 gifts donated since launch. The theme of community and affordable, practical cheer, is also present in the M&S food advert. The ad sees the return of Dawn French as a festive fairy, and she also appears as herself. We see the actress and comedian stuck in gridlocked traffic, but with a wave of the fairy's wand, a delivery truck is converted into a Christmas party. The festive snacks served at the party are modest and a far cry from the tables of food that we've seen in past adverts. But not all of the retailers have toned it down this year. Beauty retailer Sephora's advert stars none other than Mariah Carey as an angel. She later transforms into a Santa Claus bodysuit, and takes off in a sleigh filled with bags of shiny gifts. Experts say that as a whole, this year's adverts are reflecting the fact many shoppers will be worrying about costs this Christmas. “Value framing is part of the campaign this year,” said Shuttleworth. “And of course that’s relevant this Christmas.” ""We're seeing themes that reflect the world as we actually live it,"" agrees Hardcastle. ""Audiences don't want fantasy; they want recognition. It's proof that even at Christmas, the stories that move us most are the ones that see us."" Elsewhere, a number of retailers have gone for fictional characters. Again, this is being seen as a deliberate move given the economic backdrop. ""If you're struggling and someone's showing you a glossy life on screen, it's not going to make you feel particularly great,"" Hardcastle said. In the Aldi advert, its mascot Kevin the Carrot is back. This time, he is set to pull our heart strings as he pops the question to his beloved Katie the Carrot. Not to be outdone, Sainsbury's advert also features a famous animated character - Roald Dahl's beloved Big Friendly Giant. And Argos has also gone for the same characters as last year - cartoon duo Connie the doll and Trevor the dinosaur - who are joined this year by Inbetweeners star Simon Bird. Advertisers are set to spend a total £12bn during this festive period, according to the latest Advertising Association and World Advertising Research Centre data. John Lewis, for its part, doesn't disclose how much it spends on its Christmas advert, but Ms Hanley said they are ""confident it pays off"". And experts say it's about more than just getting consumers through the doors. ""Fundamentally, the Christmas advert is about emphasising a sense of community and togetherness,"" Dr Wallace told BBC News. Dr Wallace said that while the ads are still made for broadcast television, they are also now viral internet events, and are shared widely online. The challenge for retailers, he said, is reflecting the ""mood of the nation"" when Christmas adverts are planned months in advance. ""If they can get it right, they can really become TV moments,"" he said. ""They can set the tone for that particular year, and shape the way you remember that Christmas."""
BBC,en,business,"In his latest attempt to take on soaring beef prices, Trump has asked the justice department to launch a federal investigation. US President Donald Trump on Friday asked the Justice Department to investigate meat-packing companies over their possible role in driving up beef prices. Trump, on social media, accused the industry of contributing to the high cost of beef for US consumers ""through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation"". His call for a probe focused on potential antitrust violations comes as soaring beef prices havebecome a political problem, threatening to undercut his promises to bring down food costs in the US. The announcement also follows Republican losses in key elections this week, where voters' concerns about the cost of living and Trump's handling of the economy boosted Democrats. Trump has put beef prices at the centre of his messaging about the cost of living - and food inflation, specifically. But his other recent proposals to lower prices sparked backlash among ranchers. Last month, on social media, he urged US ranchers to lower prices for their cattle. Then, he drew their ire when he proposed importing more beef from Argentina, potentially quadrupling US purchases. At the time, ranchers worried that some of his solutions would make it harder for them to make a living, while not helping much at the grocery store. As Trump keeps pushing to lower beef prices for American consumers, his latest call for federal investigation signals a possible shift in focus, toward the meat-packing industry, which slaughters livestock and then processes and packages their meat. ""We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation's food supply,"" Trump wrote in a social media post. Retail prices for beef mince rose 12.9% in the 12 months to September, and beef steaks were up 16.6%, according to government data published in October. A pound of ground chuck - richer mince from the neck and shoulder of cows - now costs an average of $6.33 (£4.75), compared to $5.58 a year ago. The increases significantly outpaced general food inflation, which stood at 3.1%. Some economists point to supply contraints, combined with robust demand for beef, as the main reason for high prices. The country's cattle inventory has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 75 years. Decades of contraction in the industry has worsened as several years of drought have forced ranchers to slash their herd sizes - and herds take several years to rebuild. But others argue the US government could lower beef prices if it focused on the way a handful of companies dominate the market for meat processing. Today, just four firms control more than 80% of the beef slaughtering and packing market. The meat processing firms - Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef - have faced several lawsuits, including one filed by McDonald's alleging that they colluded to inflate the price of beef. Consolidation in the meat processing industry has elicited bipartisan scrutiny. The Biden administration issued an order directing agencies to tackle corporate consolidation across the food supply chain, though Trump revoked that order earlier this year. Former President Joe Biden also asked the Agriculture Department to investigate big meat packers, accusing the firms of of raising prices and boosting their profits during the pandemic."
BBC,en,technology,"The tech billionaire believes Optimus could play a big role in the lives of people around the world. It has appeared in Tesla showrooms, on its factory floors and has even posed with Kim Kardashian. But Elon Musk's vision for his human-like robot Optimus is much grander than that. Since first unveiling it at a Tesla showcase in 2022, the tech billionaire has suggested his company's droid could play a huge role in the homes and lives of people all over the world. Along with self-driving robotaxis and Cybertrucks, Musk believes Tesla robots are key to establishing a foothold in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. And investors who signed off on his$1tn (£760bn) pay package on Thursday would appear to agree. One of the many tasks Musk must complete to get his whopping pay deal is to deliver a million AI bots over the next decade. But is Tesla's big bet on humanoid robots rooted in science fiction or reality? Silicon Valley is gunning hard for humanoids. A report released by Morgan Stanley on Friday predicted Apple, which is reportedly  looking into the robots, could potentially earn $133bn a year from them by 2040. Foxconn isreportedto be deploying them at its Nvidia factory in Texas. The idea of advanced AI within a human-shaped shell is an astonishingly powerful combination in theory. It would let the tech interact with the physical world around it – and yes that includes us. While many companies have sought to develop human-like robots for factory and industrial use - such as UK robotics firm Humanoid - some are already looking to insert the tech in homes. The highly-publicised Neo from tech firm 1X, slated to launch in 2026, can do menial chores like emptying the dishwasher, folding clothes and fetching you items. It will cost $20,000 but it does come with a caveat -the WSJ reported it was actually controlled by a person wearing a virtual reality headset. Forrester analyst Brian Hopkins said the falling costs of components, combined with improvements to robot dexterity and AI, was helping to make humanoid robots feasible for a variety of different settings. ""From warehouses and restaurants to elder care and security, new use cases are gaining traction fast,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""If current trajectories hold, humanoid robots could disrupt many physical-service industries significantly by 2030."" Musk previouslytold investorshis robots had ""the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business, over time"". He went one step further after his pay package deal was approved on Thursday, saying he believed it could be ""the biggest product of all time by far, bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything"". He has also suggested it might boost Tesla's AI ambitions - particularly in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems capable of matching human abilities. ""Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus,"" hewrote on X in 2022. Elsewhere in the space, Boston Dynamics' hydraulic humanoid Atlas has captivated millions on YouTube with its gymnastics and dance routines. Viral videos of its leaps, bounds, somersaults and backflips have shown the advances in robotics over the years - with scientists now seizing upon the AI boom to boost their capabilities with systems enabling them to undertake more complex tasks. When it wasretired last year, it was replaced with a newer, fully electric model developers said could contort its metal frame in even more ways. But many of the roboticists the BBC has spoken to over the years have rolled their eyes about tech firms shaping robots like humans. Practically, there islittle reason for robots to have legs. The mechanics and hardware involved in creating machine legs are far more intensive. As one scientist put it - ""wheels are so much more efficient"". And don't get them started on why a robot doesn't need to have a head. Psychologically though, humanoids have long been a human fascination – and something reflected decades of sci-fi. You need only look to the legacy of characters such as Star Wars' C-3PO, Futurama's Bender or the Terminator to see humans might sometimes feel more comfortable around something closely resembling us. Back in reality, humanoid machines have been often far less polished and more gimmicky, clumsy and buggy than their fictional counterparts. But that appears to be changing with the likes of Optimus and sleeker droids which edge us closer to living in an uncanny valley. Tesla's droid has been appearing in more public settings as of late -serving burgers and popcorn to customers at the company's Hollywood diner. Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said in May he doesn't think the world is ready for humanoids, while simultaneously describing it as an incoming moment. There's no love lost between him and Elon Musk but on this occasion they seem to be on the same page that the robots are on their way – and Musk certainly has the power, the influence and the cash to make it happen.

BBC,en,technology,"While he has a penchant for cars and jets, the world's richest person reportedly lives a relatively modest life. Tesla boss Elon Musk has been one of the world's richest people for several years now, and that wealth recently went stratospheric when he became the first half-trillionaire. Despite this, Musk has insisted he leads a largely unglamorous lifestyle. He said in 2021 that he lived in a Texas home valued at $50,000 (£38,000). His former partner Grimes, with whom he has two children, toldVanity Fair in 2022that he does not live the extravagant life of excess luxury many assume. ""Bro does not live like a billionaire. Bro lives at times below the poverty line,"" she told the magazine. Once, she said, he refused to buy a new mattress, despite her side having a hole in it. While his day-to-day living quarters may not be as lavish as one might expect, he is known to have a love of unique cars, including one that can morph into a submarine. He also has a private jet collection, worth many millions of dollars. And then there was that small splurge back in 2022,when he bought Twitterfor a casual $44bn. Musk once had an impressive real-estate portfolio.The Wall Street Journalreported in 2019 that he had spent $100m on seven houses in about seven years - most of them a stone's throw from each other in the prestigious neighbourhood of Bel-Air, California. Collectively, the properties boasted swimming pools, a tennis court, wine cellar, private library and a ballroom. One was a ranch house once owned by legendary Willy Wonka actor Gene Wilder. But in 2020, Musk had a change of heart -tweeting that he would be""selling almost all physical possessions"" and ""will own no house"". ""Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession [sic] just weigh you down,"" he wrote. There was one stipulation - that Gene Wilder's house, ""cannot be torn down or lose any [of] its soul"". He did indeed sell the three-bedroom property - to Wilder's nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, after giving him a multi-million dollar loan to buy it. But in June 2025, Musk reclaimed ownership, after Mr Walker-Pearlman reportedly fell behind on the repayments. In 2021, Musk tweeted that his ""primary home"" was a modest prefabricated house that cost him about $50,000 on the southern tip of Texas, where his aerospace company SpaceX operates - an area that has officially become a city called Starbase. ""It's kinda awesome,"" Musk said about the humble dwelling. The following year, Musk said he did not own a home at all, using it as an example of how low his consumption is, despite his enormous wealth. ""I'm literally staying at friends' places,"" he told head of media organisation TED, Chris Anderson. ""If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms."" This is nothing new - in 2015, then-Google CEO Larry Page told author Ashlee Vance that Musk was ""kind of homeless"". ""He'll e-mail and say, 'I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?'"" There has been various speculation over the years that Musk is buying up properties around the US, however the home in Texas appears to be the only official house he personally owns. While Musk does not spend big on property, cars are a different matter. As the owner of Tesla, it's not surprising that he has a large collection of unusual, and in some cases extraordinary, vehicles. They have included a Ford Model T, the 20th Century car credited with being the first affordable vehicle, revolutionising the motor industry. Others were a 1967 Jaguar E-Type Roadster, which Musk is said to have coveted since he was a child; a 1997 McLaren F1, which he crashed and spent a lot of money repairing before selling; and a Tesla Roadster, which was the first Tesla model to go on sale and wasfamously fired into space by Muskin 2018. The most unusual, however, is the 1976 Lotus Esprit driven by James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In the film, the car, nicknamed Wet Nellie, could transform into a submarine. Musk bought the car in an auction in 2013 for almost $1m with the aim of making its submarine transformation capabilities a reality once more. Musk has admitted that planes are another thing he is happy to splurge on, but insists it is to do with his dedication to his work. ""If I don't use the plane, then I have less hours to work,"" he said in the 2022 TED interview. Among the private jets in his collection are a number of Gulfstream models, which cost tens of millions of dollars each. He uses them to travel between SpaceX and Tesla sites in the US, as well as for international travel. Musk hasdonated billions of dollars in shares to charities, according to US regulatory documents, and has pledged many millions to various causes. But his philanthropy has been criticised. TheNew York Timeslast year called it ""haphazard and largely self-serving - making him eligible for enormous tax breaks and helping his businesses"". His charitable organisation, the Musk Foundation, says on its website that it is ""dedicated to advancing humanity's progress through ground-breaking scientific research, technological innovation, and ambitious endeavours that push the boundaries of what is possible"". But the New York Times reported that the foundationfell short of the amount it was required to give awayfor three years in a row. The paper, which saw the foundation's tax filings, also found that many of its donations went to organisations with links to Musk. Elon Musk, and the Musk Foundation have been contacted for comment. When asked about philanthropy and charitable causes in the past, Musk appeared to be sceptical of traditional charitable gifts. ""I think if you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult,"" he told Chris Anderson in 2022. To Musk, the very existence of his business ventures is philanthropic: ""If you say philanthropy is love of humanity, they are philanthropy,"" he insisted. Tesla is ""accelerating sustainable energy"", he said, while SpaceX ""is trying to ensure the long-term survival of humanity"" and Neuralink ""is trying to help solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI""."
BBC,en,technology,"Shares in the property website sink after it cuts profit forecasts to step up investment in AI. Property listing website Rightmove has seen its shares plummet after revealing plans to step up investment in artificial intelligence (AI). Rightmove cut its profit growth forecasts for next year to reflect plans for higher investment in AI as well as other changes intended to increase returns. The company's chief executive, Johan Svanstrom, said AI was ""becoming absolutely central"" to the running of the business and its plans for the future. But investors were less enthusiastic, and Rightmove's shares had sunk by more than a quarter at one point on Friday. Rightmove announced plans to invest £60m over the next three years and a large part of this investment will focus on AI. ""We are already working on a wide range of exciting AI-enabled innovations for the benefit of our partners and consumers,"" Mr Svanstrom said. The company said it aimed to boost annual revenue growth to more than 10% by 2030. However, it also projected a operating profit growth of 3% to 5% in 2026, which is lower than its forecast of 9% growth this year. Rightmove is planning for its AI investment to pay off in the next three years and said it expects its operating profit to rebound after 2028. Mr Svanstrom said he was confident the investment would ""create an even stronger platform and higher-growth business over time"". But shares in the company plunged by as much as 28% in early trade on Friday, although they recovered some ground later to stand 12.5% lower at the close of trading. ""Investing for future growth is not a bad thing but the scale of the market's negative reaction implies real scepticism about its decision to put so much money into AI,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""It's possible to see how AI might help Rightmove operate more efficiently, make greater use of its increasing amounts of data and enhance user experience on the site,"" he added. ""However, there is clearly concern that Rightmove is jumping on the bandwagon in dialling up its AI spending."""
BBC,en,technology,"The most anticipated video game of all time receives a second official delay from makers Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026. One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026. It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to ""expect and deserve"". GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time. Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode. In its statement, Rockstar said it was ""sorry for adding additional time"" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience. It said it was ""incredibly excited"" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City. As ever, GTA news sparked the usual mix of anger, jokes and acceptance on social media. Streamer IShowSpeed gave a typically over-the-top response to the news during one of his online broadcasts. ""I'm gonna be 50 before this game comes out,"" he said. ""I might have kids, I might have a wife."" The account for animated character Lofi Girl, who has been locked in a never-ending study session on YouTube since 2017, joked that she ""might actually graduate before GTA 6"". While an official Domino's Pizza account encouraged Rockstar to ""call us if you need help delivering"". Others were more measured, saying they would rather developers take their time than rush out an unfinished game. The announcement follows thefiring of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studioson 30 October. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising. Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment. Rockstar has stayed tight-lipped about GTA 6, releasing only two trailers so far, withthe second arriving in May this year. With over 100 million views, the nearly three-minute video gave players more insight into the backstory of protagonists Jason and Lucia - a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida - as well as revealing new characters and map locations. Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism, with its previous big release - Red Dead Redemption 2 - delayed by roughly a year from its original release date. Increased demand for complexity and scope from players, as well as soaring development costs, has meant publishers are less willing to take risks on unfinished products. When it finally lands, GTA 6 is likely to be one of the most expensive video games ever made, but also expected to set records with its launch sales. Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen."

BBC,en,technology,"The art of making an app by describing it to artificial intelligence (AI) tops 10 new terms on the shortlist. If you've ever wanted to create your own computer program but never learnt how to code, you might try ""vibe coding"". Collins Dictionary's word of the year - which is confusingly made up of two words - is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence (AI) rather than by writing programming code manually. The term was coined in February byOpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who came up with the name to represent how AI can let some programmers ""forget that the code even exists"" and ""give in to the vibes"" while making a computer program. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025. By giving an AI tool a simple description such as ""make me a program that schedules my weekly meals"", people can use ""vibe coding"" to make basic apps without any previous programming knowledge. More complicated tools still require skill, but the practice has opened up creating digital platforms to non-coders. As many have discovered, it isn't perfect - with no guarantee the code will actually work or be free of bugs. Alex Beecroft, the Managing Director of Collins, said the term ""perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology"". Not all the words necessarily first emerged in 2025 - but Collins decided this was the year they became popular. For example ""clanker"", a term used to describe robots in Star Wars games and movies since the mid 2000s, made the list after it went viral on TikTok in July as people shared their frustrations with AI-powered machines. While ""aura farming"" - people doing things for the sake of looking cool, often when they know they're being filmed - was first used in January 2024, but became increasingly popular over the course of 2025. And the portmanteau ""broligarchy"" took off in 2024 to describe the owners of the world's biggest technology companies and their purported political influence - and was used frequently in 2025following the appearance of many of the bosses at US President Donald Trump's inauguration.

BBC,en,technology,"The highly complex technology is increasingly being tipped to transform computing. There's an old adage among tech journalists like me - you can either explain quantum accurately, or in a way that people understand, but you can't do both. That's because quantum mechanics - a strange and partly theoretical branch of physics - is a fiendishly difficult concept to get your head around. It involves tiny particles behaving in weird ways. And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power. Its mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech's current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI). This is despite a steady stream of recent big quantumannouncementsfrom tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others. Broadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate. Put them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that's more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word ""might"" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters. ""The potential is there, but the jury is still out,"" he says. ""Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI."" In terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035,according to market research group McKinsey. Meanwhile, AI's value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles. ""I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged,"" jokes Mr Hopkins. In mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks couldfall by up to 62%,while mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder. Quantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the ""hallucinations"" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error. These are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them. It's tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the""permanently shadowed craters of the moon"". Quantum computers don't look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big. They exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape. They require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It's not the sort of thing you're likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket. They're also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature. The luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world's first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020.  And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines. These machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn't stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential. ""We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives,"" said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC's Tech Life podcast. ""The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI."" Prof Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK's top quantum experts. ""Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds,"" he told Dr Dr Jim Al-Khalili on BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific. So what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they're ready? As with AI, there's a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare. Quantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers. To give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers10 septillion years- or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete. Hazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that's most likely to work for you. And that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers. Quantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks. In 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy. ""The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology,"" said researcher Ryan Hill at the time. ""A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still. ""Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge."" Last year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a ""quantum compass"", on the city's underground Tube network. GPS doesn't work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather. ""The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication,"" says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre. ""Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems."" The National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what's known as ""load shedding"" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts. And Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount. So far, so good – but we also need to talk about secrets. It is widely accepted that current forms of encryption – the way in which we store both personal data and official secrets – will one day be busted by quantum technology being able to churn through every single possible combination in record time, until the data becomes unscrambled. Nations are known to be already stealing encrypted data from each other with a view to being able to decode it one day. ""It's called harvest now, decrypt later,"" says Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University. ""The theory of how to break current forms of public key encryption await a truly operational quantum computer,"" he adds. ""The threat is so high that it's assumed everyone needs to introduce quantum-resistant encryption now."" The moment a such a computer exists is sometimes referred to as Q-day. Estimates of when it might arrive vary, but Brian Hopkins at Forrester says it could be soon - around the year 2030. Companies like Apple and the secure messaging platform Signal have already rolled out what they believe to be post-quantum encryption keys, but they cannot be applied retrospectively to current data encrypted in the traditional way. And that's already a problem. In October, Daniel Shiu, the former head of cryptographic design at GCHQ, the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency, told the Sunday Times it was ""credible that almost all UK citizens will have had data compromised"" in state-sponsored cyber attacks carried out by China – with that data stockpiled for a time when it can be decrypted and studied."
BBC,en,science,"A project to revive red kite populations in south-west Spain sees new mating pairs and chicks. A British red kite emerges from an aviary in the remote hills of western Spain and takes flight. At six months old, this is its first taste of freedom. Without a sound, it soars high in the sky above scrubland and within seconds disappears from view into a wooded valley in the distance. It is the latest release in a conservation story that has come full circle. Nearly four decades ago, the birds were extinct in England and Scotland with just a few pairs left in Wales. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, red kite chicks from Spain and Sweden were released in the Chilterns on the Oxfordshire-Buckinghamshire border. It proved so successful that the species is now thriving across the UK, with estimates of more than 6,000 mating pairs or about 15% of the world's population. Dr Ian Evans, from Natural England, was one of the early pioneers. He said: ""There were a lot of unknowns. The first lot we released, we thought they might just die or they might just move away. ""In 1991, we had our first breeding pairs and that was really an eye-opener because we thought 'well, this can be successful'. ""That was the springboard for establishing other release sites in England and Scotland."" British-born red kite chicks have now been taken to south west Spain as part of a four-year project to revive the population there from the brink of extinction. The region has fewer than 50 mating pairs due to predators like the eagle owl and human factors such as illegal poisoning and electrocution. In 2022, conservationists weregranted special licences from Natural Englandto collect red kite chicks, mostly from Northamptonshire, and send them over to the Extremadura region of Spain. More than 120 chicks have been collected, with about 30 exported each year. About the red kite The chicks are flown to Madrid and then transported 240 miles (385km) south to a wildlife hospital in Villafranca de los Barros, run by Accion por el Mundo Salvaje (AMUS). When I arrive, the small team, led by ornithologist and project manager Alfonso Godino, are hard at work. Each chick has to be weighed, measured and tagged before being fitted with a GPS backpack which allows experts to track them. The birds look lifeless as they are manoeuvred into position. Mr Godino tells me they play dead when they feel under threat. Asked whether the tagging is painful, he says it is a minor discomfort, like having your ears pierced. Alfonso says the juveniles soon get used to the large tags, which are needed so they can be observed from the ground. The birds are then moved to holding aviaries near the Portuguese border for two weeks to acclimatise to their new surroundings. The release site is quiet and remote. There is a strong stench of rotting flesh coming from a sheep's carcass that has been left to entice red kites to feed here. As the gate is removed, I half expect the chicks to rush out but, but apart from a few flutters inside the aviary, nothing happens. It takes several hours, as though they are building up courage, before one by one they leave the safety of the aviary behind and fly off into the wild. ""Now is the exciting moment when they are in the wild, they can learn to search for food, to avoid predators, to interact with other species in the area... thanks to the GPS we are going to closely monitor these birds we have released,"" Alfonso tells me. But this is a nerve-racking time for AMUS field technician Sofia Marrero. ""The mortality for raptors in general is really high during the first years of their life,"" she says. ""So now it's a little bit hard because you already know that some of them may not get to sexual maturity, so it's a bittersweet moment."" In fact, only about a quarter of the red kites released during the project have survived. The biggest threat is from predators and natural causes. In 2023, eagle owls were responsible for killing half of the project's newly released red kite chicks. In response, the team at AMUS adapted how and when the chicks are released to increase their chances of survival. A lot of work has also been done to adapt thousands of kilometres of power cables to reduce the risk of electrocution. But the biggest human risk to birds of prey is from illegal poisoning. Between 2020-2024, 3,060 red kites were tagged and fitted with GPS as part of theLife EuroKite project, spanning 40 project areas in 12 countries. By September 2024, 1,377 tagged red kites had died - 622 from natural causes, including predation, while 195 died from poisoning and 54 from illegal shooting. Experts say the figures represent just the ""tip of the iceberg"" in terms of illegal persecution. In the UK, the RSPB is working with European partners to provide advice on how to investigate cases of poisoning. A report by the charity last year revealed at least 1,344 birds of prey had been killed in the UK between 2009 and 2023. ""Raptor persecution is directly linked to game estates so in the lowlands pheasant and partridge and in the uplands grouse,"" Mark Thomas, head of investigations at RSPB says. ""All the statistics prove that... two thirds of all the convictions are for gamekeepers so these are people employed lawfully to control vermin they can control but on some estates some of these gamekeepers kill things that are fully protected,"" he adds. The charity believes licensing game estates would tackle the issue but that is disputed by the Countryside Alliance. In a statement, the non-profit organisation said: ""Any incident of raptor persecution is utterly condemnable, with the penalties already including a prison sentence along with an unlimited fine."" In Spain, the relocation project in Extremadura has seen three mating pairs so far that have produced two surviving chicks. With more tagged red kites due to reach sexual maturity next year, it is hoped these numbers will multiply. ""There are still huge areas of southern Spain where the red kite was common three decades ago and is now almost extinct,"" Mr Godino says. ""So the next step is how we can apply this experience to other areas of Spain."""
BBC,en,science,"James Watson, the godfather of DNA who discovered the ""secrets of life"" has died aged 97. In February 1953, two men walked into a pub in Cambridge and announced they had found ""the secret of life"".  It was not an idle boast. One was James Watson, an American biologist from the Cavendish laboratory; the other was his British research partner, Francis Crick. Their discovery - of the structure and function of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA - ranks alongside those of Mendel and Darwin in its significance to modern science. The full Promethean power of their achievement would slowly emerge over decades of research by fellow geneticists. It also opened a Pandora's Box of controversial scientific and ethical issues - including human cloning, designer babies and ""Frankenstein foods"". Demonstrating that DNA has a three-dimensional, double-helix shape allowed Watson and Crick to unlock the secrets of how cells worked; the means by which characteristics were passed down through generations. ""When we saw the answer we had to pinch ourselves,"" said Watson. ""We realised it probably was true because it was so pretty."" The discovery won them a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1962 and a permanent place in the historic ranks of great scientific thinkers. It also guaranteed that, if they said something controversial, it made headline news. And Watson -who has died aged 97- had plenty to say, most notoriously speculating about a link between race and intelligence. When he first suggested that black people are less intelligent, London's Science Museum cancelled a planned lecture - insisting Watson's views went ""beyond the point of acceptable debate"". He suggested ""when you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them"".  And he wondered aloud if beauty not only could - but should - be genetically encouraged. Watson was heavily criticised for saying that women should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests proved it would be homosexual. He argued he was simply in favour of choice, that it would be equally permissible to favour homosexual offspring and that it was simply natural to want grandchildren. He alienated many in his own profession, calling many fellow academics ""dinosaurs"", ""deadbeats"", ""fossils"" and ""has-beens"" in his autobiography, Avoid Boring People. In 2014, he became the first living recipient of the Nobel Prize to auction off his medal - in part to help fund future scientific discovery. A Russian tycoon bought it for $4.8m (£3m) and promptly gave it back to him. James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928 to a family who believed in ""books, birds and the Democratic Party"". He was the only son of Jean and James, who were descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers. His political interest came from his mother who worked for the Democrats. The basement of their bungalow would be pressed into service as a polling station at election time. His father's passions were science and bird-watching. Young Watson would accompany his father on birding trips. He learned that science was a discipline demanding careful observation from nature. This left no place for faith.  Brought up a Catholic by his mother, Watson described himself as an ""escapee from that religion"". ""The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father did not believe in God,"" he said. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw his father's salary suddenly cut in half and a dash to the bank to get their remaining savings out in time. Watson slept in a tiny attic room shared with his younger sister, Betty. He was a skinny teenager told to go to buy milkshakes to ""fatten him up"". He was socially awkward and expelled from school for poor grades - his work badly affected by a bout of scarlet fever. ""None of my classmates thought I would amount to much,"" he recalled. He did not think of himself as a precocious intellect but he took up a scholarship at the University of Chicago at the tender age of 15. He put it down to ""my mother knowing the dean of admissions"". University freed him from complicated social hierarchies of school life where popularity and physical stature were critical. It provided the environment where a brilliant but awkward teenager could thrive. Watson thought of majoring in ornithology, the study of birds, but changed to genetics - influenced by Erwin Schrodinger's book What is Life? He described the University of Chicago as an ""idyllic academic institution"" where he was ""instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth"". The prevailing scientific wisdom was that genes were proteins able to replicate themselves. The presence of DNA was dismissed as something ""stupid"" simply there to support the protein. Watson became fascinated by the new technique of diffraction whereby X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures. He became convinced that DNA had a structure of its own and was determined to find it. He thought the place to do that was England. At Cambridge, he met Francis Crick, a physicist by training with ""extraordinary conversational ability"" and ""the loudest laugh I have ever known"". They began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA and trying to fit them to the available evidence. In one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time, not all of this evidence was their own. Watson and Crick were in a race with another team at King's College London. Their rivals were Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. They got on well with him and appallingly badly with her. Wilkins corresponded with the Cambridge pair, sometimes exchanging his thoughts and insights. But Franklin was different. She was the most experienced chemist and an expert in diffraction. She, alongside her student Raymond Gosling, would take photographs of the patterns made by X-rays as they bounced off DNA molecules. Watson and Crick found Franklin ""hostile"" and thought she jealously guarded her research and worked in isolation. They were dismissive and sniped about her appearance, but Watson wasn't above taking a look at her work when Wilkins offered. The key evidence was Photo 51. It shows a fuzzy pattern of X-rays that fascinated the Cambridge pair. They threw themselves into a frenzy of model building, testing each theory against the new information. From this, they deduced that DNA must have a three-dimensional, double-helix structure - like a twisted ladder with rungs formed of alternating salt and phosphate groups. Their key conclusions were that, if separated, each strand provided a template for creating the other and that the order of the ""rungs"" was a code. If you can understand that code, they reasoned, you can unpick the wonders of life. Wilkins wrote to his rivals to congratulate them on winning what had, at times, been a bitter race. When he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Medicine - alongside Watson and Crick - Franklin did not accompany them. Her life was cut short by ovarian cancer at just 37. According to the rules of the Nobel committee, only the living could be honoured. Her fans felt Franklin had been cheated twice. Later Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard. He became professor of biology and had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia. Then he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an ailing institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes. In 1968, his account of the race to discover the structure of DNA, The Double Helix, was published. It is a painful examination of the story. It rakes over the personalities, controversies and bitterness from his point of view. He considered calling the book Honest Jim. But for all Professor Watson's academic achievements, his later career was overshadowed by his controversial public statements. In 1990, the journal Science wrote that ""to many in the scientific community, Watson has long been something of a wild man, and his colleagues tend to hold their collective breath whenever he veers from the script"". At a conference in 2000, Watson proved it right. He floated the idea that black people might have larger libidos than whites. His lecture argued that melanin, which gives skin its colour, boosted the sex drive. ""That's why you have Latin lovers,"" he told the delegates. ""You never have an English lover, only an English patient."" He suggested that humanity might screen out the stupid people by genetic testing. Then he gave an interview that put the biggest dent in his reputation. While promoting his autobiography, Watson spoke to the Sunday Times. The piece quoted him as ""gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really"". Watson went on to admit this ""hot potato"" was difficult to address and his hope was that everyone was equal. However, he said, ""People who have to deal with black employees find this not true"". He later apologised but his research institute stripped him of executive power and kicked him upstairs as chancellor emeritus. James Watson spent the rest of his life continuing to raise money for medical research, often shamelessly reaching for the heart strings. ""Nothing attracts money like a quest for the cure to a terrible disease,"" he said. He never stopped causing waves, warning that ""Viagra is fighting evolution"". Men, he also argued, should store sperm in their teens to avoid an increased possibility of fathering children with developmental difficulties. He repeated his views on the link between race and intelligence in a 2019 documentary, after which the scientific community revoked his remaining honorary positions. He will be remembered as the ""Godfather of DNA"", the man who unravelled the secrets of life, and a world-class controversialist who often put his foot in his mouth."
BBC,en,science,"A top virology expert tells the BBC that the ""super-infectious"" avian influenza virus could mutate. The bird flu virus infecting farm flocks across the UK could be the most infectious yet, the government's former top expert in avian virology has warned. The Pirbright Institute's Professor Ian Brown, formerly director of science at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), said farmers should be ""prepared for the worst"". With a national mandatory housing order brought into force in England on Thursday, one free-range egg producer in Wiltshire told the BBC she felt ""terrible"" bringing her 32,000 hens inside but an outbreak would be ""disastrous"". The government said the mandatory housing order would ""bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing"". So far this season - which began in October -there have been 26 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza(HPAI) H5N1 on farms across the UK, with 22 in England alone. Whole flocks have to be culled when an outbreak occurs. Professor Brown told the BBC that the current virus was ""as super-infectious as any high pathogenicity avian influenza we've ever seen"". He added that farmers should now ""prepare for the worst, I'm afraid"". ""We had a very, very serious epidemic between 2021 and 2023 - in excess of 350 outbreaks in the UK. That's off the scale,"" he explained. ""Now, it's really, really difficult to state what the final size of this outbreak would be, but the early signals are not great."" He added that the threat level meant the poultry industry needed to ""batten the hatches down, review their biosecurity and redouble their efforts"". Sarah Godwin runs a mixed egg, arable and dairy family farm near North Wraxall, in Wiltshire, with her husband and brother-in-law. Her 32,000-laying hens would normally be outdoors for most of the day. They now have to be kept in their barns around the clock. ""It is terrible. We would love to see them out but it is just a necessary evil because the risk of them catching avian influenza is so high and the consequences are so disastrous for a producer, and for the hens as well,"" she explained. But despite bringing the hens inside and putting in place strict biosecurity measures, Mrs Godwin remains ""very nervous"". She said: ""It only takes a tiny, tiny bit of contaminated muck from a wild bird or something that's been brought into the shed on somebody's boots. ""It's literally grammes that can infect the whole flock. And at that point, the whole flock has to be culled."" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) still says the risk to the general public's health is ""very low"" while the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said bird flu poses a very low food safety risk and that properly-cooked poultry and eggs are safe to eat. But Professor Brown warned that the virus needed to be continually monitored for mutation. ""The good news is, basically, these viruses are still bird viruses. They don't want to be in a human,"" he said. ""We have to continually monitor the virus, because it's an influenza virus and influenza viruses change. ""Even when they're happy in a species such as birds they still undergo changes. They make mistakes and errors when they replicate. ""So that could always spew out a variant that might be more infectious for humans."" The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss urged all bird keepers to comply with the new housing measures and to continue to exercise ""robust biosecurity measures, remain alert for any signs of disease and report suspected disease immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency"". ""I appreciate the impact these measures have on industry and am extremely grateful for the continued cooperation of the poultry sector,"" she said. ""We know from previous years that housing birds will bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing."" The British Poultry Council's chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said the housing order was ""the right move at the right time"" while Gary Ford, from the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said it gave ""the clarity and consistency that producers have been calling for""."
BBC,en,science,"Jared Isaacman's initial nomination was withdrawn by the president in May during his high-profile feud with Elon Musk. Donald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination. The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a ""thorough review of prior associations."" While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk. Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also becamethe first non-professional astronaut to walk in spacelast year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled. Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was ""pleased to nominate"" Isaacman for the role. ""Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,"" the president wrote. The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job. It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even thoughthe US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that ""it will be an honor"" to serve in the role. ""The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,""he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. ""I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations."" Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July. Isaacman's initial nomination withdrawal came just days afterElon Musk left the Trump administration, following a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of government departments with his Doge initiative, leading to thousands of job cuts. Concerns were voiced over Isaacman's ties to Musk and his SpaceX company, where Isaacman has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has also made donations to the Democrats in past elections. His nomination has encountered scepticism, and at his initial confirmation hearing in April, members of both parties questioned Isaacman about possible conflicts of interest, budget cuts and his desire to send astronauts to Mars. They expressed fears he would sacrifice the long-planned Moon mission to focus on Mars, but Isaacman said both can be possible. ""We don't have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars, or Moon has to come first versus Mars,"" he later added. The billionaire - who was a high-school dropout - made his fortune from payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was 16. Isaacman has a longstanding interest in flying - having first taken pilot lessons in 2004 and later setting a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world in a light jet."
BBC,en,science,"The find shows that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations. The very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya. Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years. Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten. The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations. According to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find,published in the journal Nature Communications, provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution. ""We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,"" he said. ""This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was."" Archaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method. The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil. ""What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,"" he told BBC News. ""These  guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them."" Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,"" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya. These sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away.  But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food."" The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them. And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. ""Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants."" There is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance. ""The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier. ""They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food."" At around 2.75 million years ago, the region was populated by some of the very first humans, who had relatively small brains. These early humans are thought to have lived alongside their evolutionary ancestors: a pre-human group, called australopithecines, who had larger teeth and a mix of chimpanzee and human traits. The tool users at Namorotukunan were most likely one of these groups or possibly both. And the finding challenges the notion held by many experts in human evolution that continuous tool use emerged much later, between 2.4 and 2.2 million years ago, when humans had evolved relatively larger brains, according to Prof Braun. ""The argument is that we're looking at a pretty substantial brain size increase. And so, often the assertion has been that tool use allowed them to feed this large brain. ""But what we're seeing at Namorotukunan is that these really early tools are used before that brain size increase."" ""We have probably vastly underestimated these early humans and human ancestors. We can actually trace the roots of our ability to adapt to change by using technology much earlier than we thought, all the way to 2.75 million years ago, and probably much earlier."""
BBC,en,science,"The persistent pollutants which build up in the environment have been linked to serious illnesses. Water companies have been ordered to tackle potentially harmful levels of so-called forever chemicals in drinking water sources for more than six million people, the BBC can reveal. Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are a group of thousands of substances used in everyday products. They are persistent pollutants which build up in the environment, and a small number have been linked to increased risk of some serious illnesses. The BBC examined 23 enforcement notices issued by the Drinking Water Inspectorate over elevated levels of PFAS which could ""constitute a potential danger to human health"" to see how many people were affected. Industry body Water UK said it was confident drinking water was safe. But Water UK called for a ban on the chemicals to prevent accumulation. Amid growing worries about these chemicals, water companies have been required since 2021 to test for 47 of the most concerning ones in water supplied to customers' homes and drinking water sources such as aquifers and reservoirs. In the last four years, 1.7 million tests for individual forever chemicals have been carried out across the network. At least 9,432 of those recorded PFAS levels above the level which the DWI sayscould constitute a potential danger to human health. When a test result is above or likely to breach this level - set at 0.01ug/L - (micrograms per litre) the Drinking Water Inspectorate issues enforcement notices to the water company requiring action to be taken to ensure water is safe. The BBC analysed the enforcement documents, highlighted by Watershed Investigations - a group of environmental journalists - to identify all the water supply areas with sanctions in place. Using publicly available information, we matched each supply system to the number of customers it serves, identifying a minimum of six million people. Forever chemicals have been used prolifically since the 1940s in thousands of products from frying pans to medical equipment to school uniforms. Over time they have found their way into the environment - and the water that gets treated for drinking - through the washing of PFAS products, storm runoff and releases from industrial sites, according to Dr William Hartz, an environmental chemist specialising in PFAS at research institute NILU in Norway. He said this might include PFAS leaching out as rainwater filters through landfill sites or firefighting training sites, where the use of some firefighting foam directly releases forever chemicals into the environment. The study of PFAS is an emerging field but a small number of these chemicals have been identified as carrying significant risks to human health. Earlier this year the World Health Organizationraised significant concernsabout two specific compounds.It classifiedPFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic -increasing the risk of thyroid, testicular and kidney cancers. Both substances are now banned. But Megan Kirton, senior projects officer at environmental charity Fidra, said the chemistry of PFAS meant they do not easily break down, so even if banned they remain in the environment unless treated by water companies. ""It's a very tough situation that we're in, because PFAS is very hard to get out of water. It's like trying to get milk out of your coffee once you've already poured it in there,"" she said. The BBC assessed more than 2,000 individual test results from 2024, obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, to identify which specific PFAS compounds were being found when levels breached the limits. This showed that both PFOS and PFOA were found in more than 350 of the drinking water tests. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has said that water quality remains safe because, once a sanction is issued, water companies are required to increase testing, change or strengthen treatment for PFAS, or remove a source of drinking water altogether. This process can take several years and requires months of monitoring before a sanction is removed. The inspectorate told the BBC that it ""operates one of the world's most comprehensive PFAS monitoring programmes"", ensuring the public can have ""complete confidence in the safety of their drinking water"". However, environmental charities and the Royal Society of Chemistry have raised concerns that UK guidelines are not legally binding and that the limits, which are 2.5 times higher than those of the US, should be reduced. ""I think we have a pretty good idea of both what PFAS are in the waters in the UK, and knowing that these health effects happen at very low levels, so we think it's time that they put these guidance into law, to make sure water companies are fully held to account,"" said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry. In July,an independent reviewinto the England and Wales' water system commissioned by the government found that ""there is a need for stricter treatment requirements to protect public health and the environment"". The BBC understands that the government is currently preparing a white paper in response to the review which will include changes to the Drinking Water Inspectorate. But removing PFAS is very challenging for water companies with conventional water treatment infrastructure,the Environment Agency has said. Prof Peter Jarvis, professor of water science and technology at Cranfield University, said there were technologies such as nanofiltration occasionally deployed by the water industry which could be used more widely, but that these came with high costs and huge energy demands. ""We have got to have a bit of a more mature conversation about how we go about implementing these types of technology, and how we pay for them,"" he said. Water UK told the BBC that: ""Regardless of where you are in the country, when you turn on your tap, you are enjoying the very best drinking water in the world"". But speaking to the Today programme, CEO David Henderson said that in light of the rising treatment costs the chemicals should be banned. ""This £70m we are spending each and every year should be paid for by the chemical companies, it is really unfair for people through their water bills to have this added on top,"" he said. In addition to the comment from Water UK, a spokesperson from South West Water said that the five notices against it were ""precautionary"" and that it was ""investing £42 million over the next five years to upgrade the water supply system.""

BBC,en,science,"A new study estimates that about half of all churches in England have bats living in them. It's a job that can only be done under the cover of darkness. As night falls, the bat hunters make their way amongst the gravestones of Guestwick Church in Norfolk. The creaking door opens. Inside is the pitch black, deserted church and the team start to set up their specialist gear. Infrared and thermal cameras are carefully positioned, and audio detectors are set to bat friendly frequencies. The bats soon begin to emerge, darting and swooping up and down the aisles, the amplified sounds of their bat chatter filling the historic building. ""Many of these churches have been on these sites for probably 1,000 years, and probably as long as they've been standing they've had bats in them,"" says Diana Spencer, from theBats in Churches Project. Anew studypublished in the British Ecological Society's journal People & Nature has found that these historic buildings are providing vital homes for the nocturnal animals. The research, based on citizen science surveys led by the Bat Conservation Trust, estimates that half of all churches in England - that's more than 8,000 -  have bats in them. And that figure rises to about 80% for older churches. ""They're basically like a man-made forest,"" says Spencer. ""Full of little nooks and crannies where they can roost, big open flight spaces, dry spaces inside, away from the rain, where they can fly around. It is really just an absolutely perfect environment."" There are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters. The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door. The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food. Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness. About a third of the churches surveyed in the study had no idea that bats were living there. But in others, their presence was much more noticeable.  Bats can be messy houseguests. ""They're lovely, but they're problematic too,"" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick. He's responsible for the upkeep of the church - and says the bats started to become a nuisance about 15 years ago. ""There's the urine, the droppings,"" he says. ""One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work."" Bats are legally protected in the UK, so it's generally not possible to remove them. But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry. Ecologist Phillip Parker sets up his ladder to show us inside. ""The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,"" he explains. It's kitted out with CCTV cameras, allowing the team to monitor the animal's behaviour. ""What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,"" says Parker. ""We don't know where they go, but they disappear for about 10 days, and then they'll come back again. And without the CCTV, we never knew that."" A major construction project like this takes time, effort and money. The new loft, and the continued monitoring of the bats, has cost about £50,000, funded through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other partners. Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust. ""On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged. You can put wax coating on things like brass so that the urine doesn't damage it."" She recommends that anyone who finds bats in a building should contact theNational Bat Helplinefor advice. It seems more bats are seeking sanctuary in churches. ""They're losing lots of habitat - lots of woodland,"" says Spencer. ""And we're also knocking down old buildings, making our homes warmer, more airtight - there are less places for them to go."" Church users are having to learn to live alongside these creatures of the night - and some parishes are even starting to see bats as more of a treat than a trick. ""We regularly see churches having bat nights and bat events,"" says Spencer. ""And they can be a really, really good way of reaching people, particularly in the local community, who might not come into a church for a service or prayer, but they'll come in to watch the bats, because people find them really, really fascinating."""
BBC,en,science,"President Trump intervened in the talks calling the deal a ""green scam"". A landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks. More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. But US President Donald Trump had called the plan a ""green scam"" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a ""huge win"" for Trump. But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a ""plea"" for this not to be repeated. In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year. The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised. The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"". ""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,"" he said. The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting."" ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,"" he added. The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain. The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US,who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers. Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position. The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive. ""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations. This means without interventionthe International Maritime Organisationpreviously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%. The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers. Posting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: ""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping.

BBC,en,science,"Australia's rainforests are the first in the world to make the ""concerning"" switch, say scientists. Australia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found. Rainforests are usually regarded as so-called ""carbon sinks"" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones. But a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths. The lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon. ""Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,"" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University. With fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago. ""Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,"" said Dr Carle. Dr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought. Based on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow. ""We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,"" Dr Carle said. ""And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine."" Senior author Patrick Meir also described the results as ""very concerning"", telling news agency AFP that it was ""likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly"" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment. Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced itsnew carbon reduction targets, pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade. The country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - tokeep operating for another 40 years. Last month, anew report into the impact of climate changefound Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from ""cascading, compounding and concurrent"" climate risks."

He set up his camera trap after spotting fresh hyena tracks in the ghost town of Kolmanskop, Namibia. It took him ten years to get the shot, he said. The brown hyena, the rarest of all hyena species, is primarily nocturnal and tends to live a solitary life. For years, Mr van den Heever searched the deserted town, finding only traces of the elusive animal.

BBC,en,health,"Watson co-discover the double-helix structure of DNA, but his reputation was later damaged by his comments on race and sex. Nobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology. But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ betweenblack and white people. His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments. Watson shared theNobel in 1962with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery. ""We have discovered the secret of life,"" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender. In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was ""inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa"", because ""all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really"". He apologised ""unreservedly"", but nevertheless,the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee. ""Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,"" the laboratory said in a statement at the time. DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time. Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix. Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks. A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him. James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers. He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15. There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures. To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures. Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him. In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes."
BBC,en,health,"Vulnerable urged to come forward for flu jab quickly as virus has come early this year. The UK is facing a long, drawn-out flu season, the boss of the NHS in England is warning. Sir Jim Mackey said there is ""no doubt"" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced. It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected. NHS England is issuing a ""flu jab SOS"", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it. More than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter. Sir Jim said: ""There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced. ""Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night. And, unfortunately, it looks like that fear is becoming reality. ""Australia has just endured its worst flu season on record — over 410,000 cases — and all the signs suggest the NHS will face similar challenges in the months ahead. From December through to March, our hospitals will be at capacity."" People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS. Appointments can be booked online, by phoning 119 or at local pharmacies and GPs. Children aged two to 16 can also get vaccinated with a nasal spray. That's mainly to help stop flu spreading. Other people can buy a flu vaccine from high street chemist shops and some supermarket pharmacies. Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions were lifted combined with immunity being low. Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths. Flu rates are currently three times higher than normal for this time of year, with the highest rates seen in children and young people. But health officials have warned the virus will start spreading to older groups in the coming weeks. Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""With just weeks left to ensure best protection against the worst of the flu season, we are issuing an urgent SOS to the eligible people who have yet to get jabbed this year. ""It is vital that the public use the available appointments we have running next week to stamp out this early wave of flu cases and help shield themselves ahead of winter. ""The vaccine is proven to be safe and help prevent those at risk from getting seriously ill and even hospitalised from flu."""
BBC,en,health,"Rules about administering drugs such as Botox and Mounjaro have not kept up, says Wales' regulator. For Lizzie Day, having Botox was as much a part of her routine as getting her morning coffee. It was only when a doctor friend raised concerns about a ""fat-dissolving"" treatment she was using that the 30-year-old took stock and started questioning what was going into her body. Until this point, the recruitment consultant admitted she would just ""jump on the bandwagon"" of the latest aesthetic treatment to be discussed on social media. Wales' regulatorHealthcare Inspectorate Wales(HIW) believes a comprehensive review is required into the type of services available, as well as into who provides them and where. Its head Alun Jones said regulation has not kept up, creating ""loopholes and anomalies"", while one GP likened the current situation to a ""free-for-all"". The Welsh government said brands of botulinum toxin such as Botox and weight-loss medicines can only be supplied with a prescription and a scoping exercise will be carried out early next year to see if further regulation is needed. Botulinum toxin - commonly known by the brand name Botox - is also sold under several other licensed brands in the UK, including Azzalure, Bocouture and Dysport. ""I had no idea what was being injected into me,"" Lizzie said. ""It's just hype - it's a trend, a bit like fashion - if everyone buys the same handbag it becomes popular and I'd say it's the same for aesthetics."" In England anyone prescribing anti-wrinkle or weight-loss injectionsMounjaro and Ozempicmust be registered with theCare Quality Commission(CQC). However, in Wales only doctors are required to register with the Welsh equivalent,  HIW. This means other healthcare professionals are not legally required to meet the same standards or be routinely inspected. Despite this, many do not question who carries out work, as Lizzie adds: ""It's just like going to get your coffee in the morning - popping in for a bit of Botox."" Lizzie has lived in Manchester for the past decade, where she said treatments such as fillers, jaw-line enhancement and laser treatment are the norm for many. It was only when a doctor friend back home in south Wales raised concerns about a ""fat-dissolving"" treatment she was using, that she took stock. She now gets Botox treatment with a GP at a private clinic in the Vale of Glamorgan, where she will also have treatment declined if they don't think it's necessary - something she was not accustomed to elsewhere. ""I did beg him for Mounjaro,"" she laughed. ""But he said 'sorry, you don't qualify'. ""But I know some people who will get told no by one person and will go anywhere to get it."" HIW's Alun Jones said a comprehensive review is required. ""If you're a non-clinical individual providing Botox injections, it's hard to see where the oversight comes from,"" he added. ""The legislation that empowers us to act is quite out of date."" He said carrying out certain procedures requires HIW registration, but only if provided from a fixed, physical location. ""So you could provide certain services on a mobile basis and you would no longer need to be registered with us,"" Mr Jones added. He said monitoring and inspections would drive up standards or spot bad practice, which in turn would keep the public safe. ""What the public might not know is the person giving them an injection has had minimal training and perhaps they're not equipped to cope with a medical emergency should there be a reaction to that injection,"" he said. Hannah Jones, from Cardiff, started using what she thought was Botox when she turned 30 last year. But she kept returning for top-ups every fortnight because it wasn't having the desired ""freezing"" effect. It was only when she came across contradictory advice from another provider online that she started questioning what was being injected into her face, as doses had never been discussed. She also learned she needed to wait 12 weeks between these injections, and prescribers of Botox had to see patients face-to-face, whereas she had only ever received injections from a third party, not the named prescriber of the medicine. ""That was a major red flag,"" she said. ""I think it's really important that people do their research before they have these treatments."" These are issues the aesthetics industry itselfhas long campaigned to change, right across the UK, with a new bill drawn up earlier this year in Scotland. Dr Tom Kamal is a GP registrar in Barry, but also runs his own private clinic in the Vale of Glamorgan, where he provides aesthetic treatments such as Botox, as well as weight-loss injections - which can have severe side effects if not properly administered. He said he has treated many clients who had previously unnecessarily moved up through the doses of Mounjaro very quickly. ""Everyone seems to think that the higher the dose, the more rapid the weight loss is, but that's actually not the case - it's no wonder they experience side effects."" He said under the right supervision the medicine ""can make a massive difference"" but the side effects can range from nausea, constipation and diarrhoea, to more sinister things such as pancreatitis and gallstones. Dr Kamal described the situation in Wales as ""a free-for-all"". With the non-surgical aesthetics industry estimated to be valued at £3bn, Dr Kamal said the challenge for regulators is keeping up with the pace of change in a sector driven by social media trends. ""Saying no is one of the most important things that we do here in clinic,"" he said, adding that it would be easy to capitalise on trends and provide unnecessary services for clients willing to pay. It's advice such as this that Lydia Cheetham from Penarth wishes she had been given eight years ago, when the trend was ""big lips, big bum, big cheeks - it was everything bigger"", she said. Lydia had her first lip fillers at 18, only to have them painfully dissolve a few years later. ""I wish I had never gone so crazy in the first place because I think I'm still living with the lasting effects around my mouth and I don't know if that'll ever go away fully,"" she said. ""I wish someone had just said 'look you do not need all this'. ""There needs to be much more regulation to stop people doing things just because it's trending this year or your friends have done it."" The Welsh government said these medications ""can only be supplied with a prescription from an appropriately-qualified healthcare professional, who must act in accordance with the standards set by their respective professional regulatory bodies"". ""Failure to meet those standards can lead to regulators to limit or suspend healthcare professionals' practice,"" a spokesperson added. ""We recently introduced a mandatory licensing scheme for acupuncture, dry needling, body piercing, electrolysis, tattooing and semi-permanent makeup. ""We will undertake a Wales-specific scoping exercise early next year to ascertain whether further regulation is needed and will continue to engage with other governments across the UK on this issue."""
BBC,en,health,"Dr Mark Watson is suspended for licking beer from a younger colleague's cleavage. A doctor accused of pouring beer down a younger colleague's cleavage before licking it off and touching her breasts has been suspended for a year. Dr Mark Johnson, who was working at West Suffolk Hospital at the time of the incident, also allegedly sent ""derogatory and sexually demeaning"" messages to another junior colleague. Some of these messages included comments about the size of his colleague's breasts, sex positions and oral sex, a tribunal was told. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPT) said some of Dr Johnson's actions constituted sexual harassment and suspended him from practising for 12 months. During the hearing the General Medical Council (GMC) representative argued Dr Johnson should be banned indefinitely from the profession. The MPT panel, however, concluded his ""conduct was not persistent nor was it a pattern of predatory behaviour"" and that he was ""capable of remediation"". Dr Johnson joined West Suffolk Hospital as a consultant in 2013, before leaving 10 years later following disciplinary proceedings. The panel heard he sent sexual and inappropriate messages to a junior colleague about other colleagues between November 2018 and November 2019. During a work Christmas party in December 2022, Dr Johnson moved his hand up and down a colleague's back, blew smoke from a vape in her face and kissed her. Then he was said to have tipped some of his drink onto the junior colleague's cleavage before licking it from her skin. The GMC suggested this was ""a grave violation"" of her ""dignity"", while the MPT said his actions were ""sexually motivated and constituted sexual harassment"". The MPT ruled the conduct of Dr Johnson, who was most recently employed at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, was ""inherently serious, deliberate, and sexually motivated"". While it concluded his fitness to practise was impaired, it said he had ""developed meaningful insight"" and ""embedded sustainable behavioural change"". Dr Richard Goodwin, the medical director at West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We referred Dr Johnson to the GMC following an internal process, prompted by reports of potential sexual misconduct. ""We're committed to eradicating sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace by promoting a culture that fosters openness and transparency, and never tolerates unwanted, harmful or inappropriate sexual behaviours."" A spokesperson for the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We can confirm that this doctor is not currently working at the trust, and that the process of formally ending his employment is starting immediately.""

BBC,en,health,"BBC finds a fifth of care homes rated ""inadequate"" were not reinspected within a year or more. Care homes that are graded as inadequate or requiring improvement are often not being reinspected for a year or more, a BBC investigation has found. More than 2,100 care homes in England as of October this year were rated as ""requires improvement"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) - but the BBC found three quarters of those had not been reinspected within a year or more. A fifth of the 123 homes rated as ""inadequate"" - the lowest rating - have not been reinspected within the same time frame. BBC analysis of CQC data found one home rated inadequate in 2022 has not been reinspected since, despite the report highlighting residents were at risk of pressure sores, infection, dehydration and exposure to chemicals. As a result of the delays, families of residents living in poorly rated care homes did not always know whether improvements had been made. The family of one 24-year-old man who died in a Cornwall care home have called for homes to be inspected annually. Lugh Baker died at Rosewood House care home in Launceston, Cornwall, in 2021. A coroner found failings in relation to his care plan and gaps in monitoring after his death, which remains unexplained. The CQC inspected in 2022 and 2023, telling the home it needed to make improvements, but it has not been back to inspect since. Mr Baker's mother, Trudy Polkinghorn, and sister, Erin Baker, said they felt ""despair"" and were disappointed in the regulator. The CQC said it had been ""regularly monitoring"" the service through information it received and the home said it had acted on every recommendation in the coroner's report. The CQC rates homes into four categories - outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate. It previously reinspected care homes rated as ""requires improvement"" within a year and homes rated as ""inadequate"" within six months, but got rid of these timeframes when it changed its inspection framework in 2021. Inspections are now carried out on what it calls a more flexible ""risk basis"", prioritising the homes it deems the riskiest. Mr Baker had been living in Rosewood House for six months before he died. At the time, it was rated ""good"" following an inspection in 2018. Ms Polkinghorn described him as a ""light"" and a ""joy"" in their family. ""He wanted to get up every morning at 07:30, put the dance tunes on and he wanted everyone to dance with him,"" she said. Mr Baker had a rare genetic condition which caused severe learning difficulties, as well as epilepsy and difficulty swallowing. His care plan stipulated he was only allowed to eat certain foods while supervised and sitting up to avoid choking. Mr Baker was discovered in his room in April 2021 with an unwrapped, partially eaten chocolate bar by his bed. The inquest found no evidence of choking. A coroner's report criticised the home, saying staff were unfamiliar with his condition and although residents were supposed to be constantly monitored via CCTV, there were times this did not happen for him. After its 2018 inspection, the home was scheduled to be reinspected within two-and-a-half years. But it was not inspected until four years later, in 2022, a year after Mr Baker's death, following the scrapping of set inspection reviews. The CQC then reinspected in 2023. On both occasions the home was rated as ""requires improvement"" and told it would be monitored to make changes. There has not been another inspection since. Ms Polkinghorn said: ""When I can get up off the floor out of the realms of total despair, I am so angry."" Ms Baker said homes should be inspected annually ""at the very least"". ""If you have a changeover of staff, or anything like that, you need to make sure it's still caring for the people,"" she said. Rosewood House said their ""heartfelt sympathies remained with Lugh's family"". A spokesperson said they had acted on every recommendation in the coroner's report into Mr Baker's death, ""strengthening monitoring systems and introducing more detailed care plans"" and remained committed to providing ""safe"" and ""high-quality"" care. The CQC said it had been ""regularly monitoring"" the service through information it received. The CQC regulates all health and adult social care services in England. It can take enforcement action if it judges a care home to be underperforming, including issuing warning notices requiring specific improvements, placing a home into special measures, and suspending the registration of a service in serious cases. The regulator was previously warned it needed to improve its performance. Anindependent review of the CQCin October 2024 found multiple failings, including long gaps between inspections and some services running for years without a rating. It found the regulator had experienced problems because of a new IT system, and concerns were raised that the new inspection framework was not providing effective assessments. There was also a lack of clarity around how ratings were calculated. BBC analysis of CQC data found 70% of the 204 ""requires improvement"" rated homes in the South West have not been reinspected in a year or more. Eileen Chubb, a former care worker and campaigner who runs the charity Compassion in Care, said she regularly heard from families and staff frustrated by long gaps between inspections. She said: ""We've seen the worst care homes - diabolical homes - and they're not inspected for two or three years."" She said whistleblowers had told her they approached the CQC about ""terrible"" homes, but when the regulator inspected it was ""too late"" in cases where residents had died. Some providers said the delays were unfair to owners of care homes too. Geoffrey Cox, director of Southern Healthcare which operates four care homes in the south of England, three of which are rated ""outstanding"", said he had one ""good"" rated home that had not had an inspection for seven years. ""It's far too long,"" he said, adding that reports which were years old ""lost credibility"", undermining public confidence in them. ""We want to demonstrate that we're really good at what we do and we want to be recognised for that,"" he said. One family told the BBC it was ""such an effort"" to encourage the CQC to ""take any action at all"" after a loved one died at a home in Norwich. Karen Staniland's mother Eileen died after an unwitnessed fall in her room at Broadland View care home in Norwich in 2020, while a staff member who was supposed to be looking after her slept on duty. Her care plan stipulated she must be checked on hourly at night, that she was given a bed which could be lowered to prevent falls and that a sensor mat should be provided to alert staff if she tried to get up. A local authority safeguarding report after her death found ""no aspect"" of her care plan had been followed. The carer responsible had falsified records to suggest checks had been carried out and was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years, for willful neglect in February 2023. The home was rated ""good"" from an inspection in 2017, but a former Broadland View employee, who has asked not to be named, told the BBC the home was not providing quality care. ""Safeguarding issues weren't being documented, and the equipment and training weren't very good,"" she said. ""There were these pressure alarm mats, but as soon as you stood on them, they would slip from underneath your feet – they were used as preventions, but were actually causing the falls."" The former worker said she had reported concerns to the CQC on ""several occasions"" but there was ""no follow up"". The regulator did not inspect the home until three years after Eileen's death, downgrading it to ""requires improvement"". A coroner's report in 2023 found the home's manager did not accept many of the CQC's concerns and that several promised improvements had not been implemented. Two years on, the home has still not been reinspected. Ms Staniland said the family had been left ""dismayed"" and ""disappointed"" in the CQC. ""I don't think it is a regulator, if our experience is anything to go by,"" she added. Broadland View care home said it had ""learnt from the past"" and had introduced new digital monitoring, stronger night-time supervision and regular independent audits to ensure residents were safe and cared for. The CQC said it continued to monitor Broadland View, and it would ""continue to work closely with people who work in services and people who use them to understand the issues the sector is facing"". It said it had a clear commitment to increase the number of assessments it carried out, ""in order to give the public confidence in the quality of care they will receive, and to update the ratings of providers to give a better picture of how they are performing"".

BBC,en,health,"Researchers are trialling a new technique to monitor brain function in newborns. Three-week-old Theo is fast asleep in a cot, unaware he is helping to trial new technology that could change the lives of others. Dr Flora Faure is gently fitting him with a small black cap that looks like a swimming cap, or something a rugby forward might wear. It is covered with hexagonal lumps, containing technology that monitors how his brain is working. Researchers at theRosie Maternity Hospitalin Cambridge say they are the first in the world to trial a new technique that could speed up diagnosis and care for children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy and learning difficulties. It could be available in UK hospitals within the decade. ""It's the first time that light and ultrasound have been used together like this to give a more complete picture of the brain,"" says Dr Faure, a researcher from the Fusion (Functional UltraSound integrated with Optical Imaging in Neonates) study. In the weeks leading up to and following birth, ourbrains change every day. Brain injury in newborns is a major reason for lifelong disability, and aprogramme to reduce brain injuryin childbirth is currently being rolled out across the NHS. The injury can affect the brain's ability to communicate with the body, leading to conditions such asepilepsy, which causes seizures, orcerebral palsy, which affects movement and coordination. It ismore common in premature birthsbut can be caused by a number of issues, including oxygen deprivation, haemorrhage, infection or birth trauma. But for the five in every 1,000 babies who have a brain injury, the current monitoring methods struggle to predict how and to what extent the child will be affected as they grow. Explaining how the cap works, Dr Faure says: ""The light sensors monitor changes in oxygen around the surface of the brain - a technique known as high-density diffuse optical tomography - and the functional ultrasound allows us to image the small blood vessels deep in the brain."" But the device is also different because it is portable, so it can monitor babies more regularly, and from the comfort of their cot. Consultant neurosurgeon Dr Alexis Joannides believes it could have several advantages over the traditionalMRI(magnetic resonance imaging) orCUS(cranial ultrasound) scans. ""MRI has limitations for two reasons: one is the cost and availability of scan slots,"" he explains. ""The other is that you have to take the baby to a noisy scanner, wait maybe 20 minutes for the scan and then take the baby back again. ""It means, realistically, you can't perform a series of scans, but in those first weeks, the brain can change daily so having a way of doing repeated tests is incredibly powerful."" MRI and CUS are also considered to have limited ability to predict the nature of any impairment due to the complex relationship between brain structure and function, although astudy led by Imperial College Londonin 2018 reported that accuracy could be enhanced with an additional 15-minute scan. By conducting regular tests on infants, it is hoped that problems will be identified much earlier, and therapies and interventions can begin sooner. The charityAction Cerebral Palsyhas welcomed the research. ""For many children with cerebral palsy, the road to diagnosis is a long one, and families can spend years knowing their child is 'at risk' of developmental issues but not fully understanding what that will mean,"" says its founder Amanda Richardson. ""Technology like this could make all the difference, but it's important that the capacity of community therapists is boosted to keep up with demand, as there is already a long wait for help."" Prof Topun Austin is a consultant neonatologist and director of the Cambridge University Hospital's Evelyn Perinatal Imaging Centre. His research focuses on brain treatments at the extremes of life – young and old. He explains: ""The Fusion study aims to develop and demonstrate a system for the cot-side assessment of brain activity in newborn infants and is currently the first of its kind in the world. ""We have spent 12 months successfully proving the concept with the help of healthy and premature babies and will now focus on babies considered to be at higher risk of brain damage. ""Understanding brain activity patterns in both term and preterm infants can help us identify those most vulnerable to injury at an early stage."" Theo is one of the healthy term babies taking part in the trial, but his mother, Stani Georgieva, feels it is important to contribute. ""His dad and I are both scientists and when Theo grows up he'll be able to take advantage of all of the advancements that have been made through research, so we felt it was important for him to be a little part of that understanding,"" she says. Dr Joannides is also co-director of theNIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Brain Injury, based in Cambridge. It exists to help develop new technologies to improve the lives of people with brain injury. The centre has funded a researcher for the study and will lend its expertise to help roll out the device across the NHS, should the study prove successful. ""We still have hurdles to overcome, but we hope, within three to five years we'll have a product that can be evaluated more widely,"" he says. ""Cost permitting, it could not only monitor babies with a known problem, but also be a screening tool to help identify others who may be at risk."" NIHR is running a national drive to encourage more people to engage with health research. Moredetails about the campaign can be foundon the organisation's website.

BBC,en,health,"Thousands of offshore workers are too heavy for the limitations of helicopter winch systems. Thousands of North Sea oil workers are being told they must lose weight if they are to keep flying offshore - or face losing their jobs. From November next year, industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the maximum clothed weight for a worker heading offshore should be 124.7kg (19.5 st) - so they can be winched to safety in an emergency. The 249kg (39st) maximum Coastguard rescue helicopter winch load is made up of that figure plus the average 90.3kg (14st) weight of a rescue worker, a 29kg (4.5st) stretcher and the 5kg (0.8st) kit. OEUK said more than 2,200 workers were currently above the weight limit, and jobs could be lost in the worst case scenario. One offshore worker, Phil Perry, told BBC Scotland News he was managing to lose weight - but was worried colleagues could lose their employment when the new rules come into force. The newsafe weight limit policycomes after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) warned that rescue winches - which are critical during offshore emergencies - cannot safely lift heavier people. OEUK said the average weight of offshore workers had risen by almost 10kg (1.5st) since 2008. The decision to implement a safe weight limit for offshore workers follows a review by industry experts over the past two-and-a half years. Rules about shoulder size were previously introduced for workers travelling to and from offshore installations by helicopter. Passengers with a shoulder width of 22in (56cm) or more were classed as""extra broad""and had to sit next to a similarly large helicopter window, so they could escape. Phil Perry, 42, from Aberdeen, was 129kg (20st) at one stage - which would have been over the new limit. He is now 118kg (18.5), and his target weight is 110kg (17st). Mr Perry said the fear of losing his job was an added motivation to keep his weight down. ""There's not a lot of people talking about it offshore yet,"" he said. ""You've kind of got to understand that back in the 70s and the 80s the average person was about 70-odd kilos, it's obviously going in an upward trend. ""I think you maybe have to do something about that, because you don't want to be the one stranded there because you're too heavy to be lifted out."" Mr Perry said it was possible to be healthy while working on a platform in the North Sea. ""There are a lot of healthy people offshore, there are gyms, you can go for a walk round the helideck, you can be fit there, I think it just comes down to personal mindset of each individual. ""There's a wide range of fruit and healthy options, but there's also crisps and sweets which does not help. ""Everybody can lose weight, it's keeping it off that's the hard thing. I was one of these people that did these kind of crazy diets, but you can't keep it off."" He said he started eating the right foods at the right times, adding: ""I started seeing the results."" Mr Perry said he ""definitely"" feared the new rules would lead to job losses. ""It will affect the pool available to go offshore, there's a lot of us out there, and sadly it's just the way that it's going to go, that people will start losing their jobs, which is not good for anybody,"" he said. Mr Perry added that the onus was on staff themselves, as well as employers, to make a difference. Graham Skinner, the health and safety manager at OEUK, said it was hoped the new safety policy - as part of a ""robust safety culture"" - would not lead to job losses, but he could not rule it out. ""That would be the absolute worst-case scenario. ""Employers will have a duty to support their workers through this and try to find reasonable solutions for it, but in the very worst cases that would be the case for some people."" Mr Skinner described it as ""really important"" that there was a clear message to the workforce that the new rules were going to come in. ""Hopefully that is the impetus for everyone to get behind the policy and lose weight in time for November next year,"" he said. ""There are those who are going to have a real challenge over the next 12 months to lose weight to get under the weight limit. ""There is about 2,270 that are going to have to lose a little bit of weight to make sure they can continue working after November next year. ""At that point an offshore worker who weighs over 124kg will not get their medical and that will preclude them from getting on a helicopter."" However, Mr Skinner said they were ""really confident"" that the ""vast majority"" of workers were going to get under the weight limit. He cited the support they would get from their employers, the offshore operators, and the offshore community itself. ""We have already heard of offshore workers who are offering circuit training and gym sessions for workers,"" he added. ""So it's a great opportunity for the community to come together."" John Boland, the regional officer at the Unite union, said: ""We would hope that nobody loses their job through this and there can be support put in to stop that from happening. ""The biggest concerns we have had are from individuals that are naturally larger built and in some cases are extremely fit but are above that actual weight limit. ""Those are discussions we need to have, how we can support those individuals as well."" The mandatory implementation of the new policy will be from 1 November 2026."
BBC,en,health,"The palliative care nurse was convicted of the murder of 10 patients, and the attempted murder of 27 others. A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others. Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight. The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career. According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed ""irritation"" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing ""master of life and death"". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts. He was arrested in 2024. When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a ""particular severity of guilt"" which should bar him from early release after 15 years. He will be able to appeal the verdict. Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again. The case bears similarityto that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005. He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history."
BBC,en,health,"If you're getting a pattern of milder, recurring headaches here are four things you can do to help manage it. Headaches are something almost all of us deal with at some point. They can last from a couple of minutes to days and the pain can be sharp, dull, throbbing or stabbing and sometimes spread beyond your head to your scalp, face or even your neck. Dr Xand van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC'sWhat's Up Docs wellness podcast, knows the feeling all too well and says he gets headaches once a month or every six weeks and it ""feels like someone's drilling into my eyeball"". While it's easy to panic about what might be behind a bad headache, Dr Katy Munro, a GP and expert at theNational Migraine Centre, says it's rarely something serious. ""It's natural to worry that something is seriously wrong, but the chances of that are actually very small,"" she explains. She advises that if it's your ""first or worst headache, get it checked out by a doctor,""  but if you're getting a pattern of milder, recurring headaches, there are a few simple things you can try at home as well asseeing your GP. Dr Xand says understanding your own headaches can be surprisingly helpful as they  often don't have a single cause so keeping a diary can help you spot patterns and triggers. For some people, weather such as thunder and lightning could trigger it, while for others it might be sensitivity to light. ""The worst time for me is when we're driving in the autumn and the sun is low and the sun is flickering through the trees...it really aggravates,"" says Dr Munro. It's worth noting down things like: But, Dr Munro cautions that you shouldn't overdo it. ""I made the mistake of making mine very detailed, which was depressing. Instead keep it simple and maybe write a number from one to 10 to summarise the impact it had on your day. ""It's also useful to track how many crystal-clear days you have, not just the bad ones. Your doctor can then review it to help identify patterns. You might think that caffeine is something you should instantly avoid if you have a headache but Dr Munro says the truth is more nuanced. In small, careful doses, it can make painkillers more effective if you are not having too much caffeine on a daily basis. ""Caffeine is a co-analgesic which means it can boost the effect of a painkiller,"" Dr Munro explains, but avoid it in the afternoon and evening as it can disrupt your sleep. It's worth also thinking about your caffeine consumption more broadly - consuming lots of it every day can cause a caffeine overuse headache and if you suddenly stop, you might get a withdrawal headache. What you eat and when may make a difference if you're suffering from headaches. Dr Munro recommends following a diet similar to the Mediterranean one that is rich in protein, healthy fats and complex carbs which can help stabilise your energy levels. You should avoid quick-release sugary snacks and definitely don't skip meals as that can be a common trigger. Dr Munro says she found her headaches were helped by cutting out dairy and gluten, though that's not universal. ""I also found eating regularly and taking lunch to work made a difference,"" she says. As well as thinking about food, Dr Munro says regular exercise, good sleep, stress management and staying hydrated can also help reduce headaches. You should drink enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour and you don't feel thirsty. ""There are lots of things, like painkillers or anti-nausea tablets, you can buy over the counter that may be helpful to manage headaches"" says Dr Munro. She cautions that you should avoid ""anything containing codeine"" as it can make some headaches occur more frequently and can worsen symptoms like nausea. ""Painkillers can work extremely well but it does depend on how severe your headache is. ""If they're becoming more frequent or intense, your GP can help you find a more suitable medication."" Make sure you don't regularly take painkillers on more than two days a week as this will reduce your risk of rebound headaches."
BBC,en,health,"Some 5.4 million adults use vapes daily or occasionally compared with 4.9 million using cigarettes, figures show. For the first time in Great Britain, there are more over-16s using vapes or e-cigarettes than smoking cigarettes, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some 5.4 million adults use vapes daily or occasionally, compared with 4.9 million using cigarettes,an ONS survey for 2024 suggests. Daily use of vapes is most common among 25-49 year olds, with rising use among women. The popularity of cigarette smoking has been falling for the past decade as the harmful effects of tobacco encouraged many to quit, while less risky vape use has been rising - particularly among younger age groups. Vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking,the NHS says, since cigarettes release thousands of chemicals when they burn, many of which are poisonous and can cause cancer. Switching to vaping reduces those risks but the long-term effects of vaping aren't yet known. Health experts say vaping is not competely harmless, so children and non-smokers should never vape. The charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said the drop in smoking was ""good news for public health"" but warned that those still smoking ""are trapped in a cycle of addiction that will likely take their lives"". ASH says smoking is responsible for 70,000 deaths every year and is the leading cause of preventable death in the UK. It is urging the government to invest in and support communities where smoking rates remain high. The ONS's Opinions and Lifestyle Surveysuggests that 10% of adults aged 16 and over currently use an e-cigarette every day or occasionally - slightly more than the 9.1% who say they currently smoke. The number saying they've given up smoking has risen - 74.2% in 2024, up from 70.3% in 2023. Back in the 1970s, less than 30% had quit the habit. At that time, nearly half of the population were smokers. But much has changed since then. In 2006-2007, a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was introduced and in 2015, a ban on smoking in cars with children was brought in. More recently in 2017, plain cigarette packaging was introduced. And government legislation currently progressing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - will soon mean anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 will not be legally allowed to buy tobacco in the UK. Rules on how vapes are packaged and displayed in shops are also set to be tightened over concerns that the devices are appealing to children. It has been illegal for businesses to sell or supply single-use or disposable vapes in the UK since June.The ban is aimed at reducing environmental damage and cutting the number of children and young people vaping. The BBC understands the government will make it illegal to sell nicotine pouches and other nicotine products to under-18s as part of the Bill. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told the BBC there were no limits on how strong these pouches can be. ""The Tobacco and Vapes Bill will let us set rules on nicotine strength, flavours and packaging to keep young people safe."" The ONS survey suggests 6.7% of people aged 16 and over in Great Britain use a vape or e-cigarette every day, up from 5.9% in 2023. Another 3.3% say they use one occasionally. This equates to 5.4 million current vape users, a rise from 5.1 million in 2023. The use of e-cigarettes daily or occasionally remained highest among 16-24 year olds in Great Britain in 2024 at 13%, down from 15.8% in 2023. Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of ASH, said there were still concerns about non-smokers and young people taking up vaping."

صراحةً أعمال الشغب التي حدثت في مبنى الكابيتول الأمريكي في يناير/كانون الثاني 2021. ففي خطابه في واشنطن العاصمة في 6 يناير/كانون الثاني عام 2021، قال ترامب: ""سنتوجه إلى مبنى الكابيتول، وسنشجع أعضاء وعضوات مجلس الشيوخ والنواب الشجعان"". فيما ظهر ترامب في نسخة بانوراما وهو يقول: ""سنتوجه إلى مبنى الكابيتول... وسأكون هناك معكم. وسنقاتل. سنقاتل بشراسة"". وقد اجتُزِئت جملة ترامب عن ""القتال بشراسة"" من مقطع ناقش فيه مدى ""فساد"" الانتخابات الأمريكية؛ حيث استخدم لفظ ""قتال"" أو ""نقاتل"" خلال خطابه عشرين مرة. وكان الفارق بين المقطعين في الخطاب الأصلي أكثر من 50 دقيقة. وقد صدرت المذكرة المسربة من مايكل بريسكوت، المستشار المستقل السابق للجنة معايير التحرير في بي بي سي، الذي ترك منصبه في يونيو/حزيران الماضي. وأفادت التلغراف بأن مايكل بريسكوت أعرب أيضاً عن مخاوفه بشأن تغطية بي بي سي عربي للحرب في غزة، وعدم اتخاذ إجراءات لمعالجة ""مشكلات منهجية"" تتعلق بالتحيز ضد إسرائيل. ورداً على ذلك، قال متحدث باسم بي بي سي: ""في حال وقوع أخطاء أو حدوثها، فقد اعترفنا بها في حينها واتخذنا الإجراءات اللازمة"".

معارضة لحماس- ذات طابع عشائري أو قبلي. نشأت تلك التشكيلات المسلحة الصغيرة وسط فراغ للسلطة، وانقسام سياسي ممتد منذ سنوات في غزة، فتحولت إلى قوى أمر واقع في مناطق نفوذها، تملك السلاح والنفوذ الاجتماعي، وتشكل تحدياً أمام محاولات حصر القوة بيد سلطة واحدة. تؤدّي هذه الجماعات المسلحة أدواراً متباينة في موازين القوى داخل القطاع، وتتأرجح بين الولاء الذاتي للقبيلة أو العشيرة، والسعي لفرض النفوذ في مناطق محددة في غزة. فماذا نعرف عن هذه الجماعات؟ تعد عشيرة دغمش من أكبر وأقوى العشائر الفلسطينية في قطاع غزة، إذ يقدر عدد أفرادها داخل القطاع بنحو 3 آلاف شخص، وما يقرب من 1500 خارجه. يتمركز نفوذها في حييْ الصبرة وتل الهوى في مدينة غزة. وينتمي أعضاؤها – وفقاً لما قاله رئيس العشيرة صلاح دغمش لوسائل إعلام في 2007- لفصائل سياسية مختلفة من بينها فتح وحماس والجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين وغيرها. دخل عدد من أفراد العشيرة في مواجهات متكررة مع حركة حماس، خصوصاً بعد سيطرة الحركة على قطاع غزة عام 2007. ووقعت تلك الاشتباكات في أحياء مثل الصبرة وتل الهوى، إثر رفض بعض أفراد العشيرة تسليم أسلحتهم، ما أدى في أكثر من مرة إلى سقوط قتلى وجرحى من الجانبين، وجعل من بعض أبناء عشيرة دغمش بين أبرز المعارضين لحماس داخل مدينة غزة. وفي عام 2007، اختطف الصحفي في بي بي سي آلان جونستون من قبل ما قال إنها مجموعة – شاركت عشيرة دغمش في تأسيسها. وقال جونستون آنذاك إن العشيرة أدّت دوراً محورياً في عملية اختطافه. ووفقاً لجونستون فإن دغمش كانت تقود في وقتها الجماعة الجهادية المعروفة بجيش الإسلام - التي كانت تحتجزه بالفعل. وقال جونستون – بعد الإفراج عنه عام 2009- إن العشيرة كانت متحالفة مع حماس في السابق، لكن في وقت اختطافه كانت العشيرة وحماس في خضم أسوأ نزاع دموي شهده خلال وجوده في غزة. وفي أكتوبر / تشرين الأول 2025، اندلعت أحدث الاشتباكات بين حماس وعناصر تابعة للعشيرة، إذ تتهم حماس بعض أعضاء دغمش بالتعاون مع إسرائيل، وهو ما نفته العشيرة موضحة أن من تتهمهم حماس بالتعاون مع إسرائيل لا يزيد عددهم عن ثلاثة أفراد بادروا لاحقاً إلى تسليم أنفسهم. في 13 تشرين الأول/أكتوبر 2025، وبعد أيام قليلة من إعلان وقف إطلاق النار في القطاع، نفّذت حركة حماس إعدامات وصفتها بالـ""ميدانية"" بحق ثمانية أشخاص من عائلة دغمش بتهمة ""الخيانة""، ونشرت عبر مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي مقاطع مصوّرة توثّق العملية. وتعقيباً على ذلك، قال رئيس مجلس عائلة دغمش نزار دغمش لوسائل إعلام إن عائلته رفضت التعاون مع الجيش الإسرائيلي، ودفعت ""الثمن بتدمير منازلها ومقتل عشرات من أبنائها"" من قبل حماس. وفي هذا السياق، يصف عريب الرنتاوي، مدير عام مركز القدس للدراسات، لبي بي سي نيوز عربي علاقة حماس بعائلة دغمش ""بالإشكالية"" مشيراً إلى عمليات الإعدام العلنية والمباشرة ""التي لم تكن إلا لتثير حالة من القلق والاستنكار"" لا سيما أن وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية وعالمية وصفتها على أنها ""ممارسة خارجة عن القانون وتنتمي لمدرسة داعش في التعامل مع الخصوم"". وفي هذا السياق، يقول اللواء أنور رجب، الناطق الرسمي باسم قوى الأمن الفلسطيني لبي بي سي نيوز عربي، إن ما تقوم به حماس من إعدامات ميدانية واستهداف للعائلات ""يأتي في إطار سعي حماس لإعادة فرض سطوتها وسيطرتها على القطاع بالدم والرعب والإرهاب"" وأضاف أن حماس تقوم بضربة استباقية ضد العائلات الكبرى والنشطاء بغية ""إرهاب المواطنين من المتمرد على استمرار وجودها بعد الكوارث والدمار الذي جلبته لهم"". صدر الصورة،Facebook برزت هذه المجموعة في عام 2024، بقيادة ياسر أبو شباب، الذي ينتمي إلى قبيلة الترابين البدوية في رفح جنوب قطاع غزة. قبل أشهر، أعلن عادل الترابين، أحد قادة قبيلة الترابين، أن القبيلة تبرّأت من ياسر أبو شباب، بعد تزايد الاتهامات ضده من جانب حركة حماس بسرقة المساعدات الإنسانية والتنسيق الأمني مع إسرائيل، مؤكداً أن ""ياسر أبو شباب لا يمثل القبيلة، وإنما يمثل نفسه فقط"". ونفى ياسر أبو شباب هذه الاتهامات قبل أن يتراجع ويعترف بعلاقات محدودة مع إسرائيل وذلك لوسائل إعلام إسرائيلية، قائلا: ""طالما أن الهدف هو الدعم والمساعدة [من الجيش الإسرائيلي] ولا شيء أكثر من ذلك، عندما نذهب في مهمة نُخطرهم - ولا شيء أكثر - ونُنفّذ العمليات العسكرية"". وفي هذا الإطار، قالت صحيفة ""تايمز أوف إسرائيل"" إن إسرائيل تدعم جماعة مسلحة تعارض حماس في غزة، مشيرةً إلى أنها جماعة من عائلة بدوية محلية، ما يرجّح أن تكون إشارة ضمنية لمجموعة أبو شباب. ووفقاً للصحيفة الإسرائيلية ذاتها، قال أفيغدور ليبرمان، زعيم حزب إسرائيل بيتنا المعارض، لإذاعة كان الإسرائيلية إن رئيس الوزراء بنيامين نتنياهو وافق بشكل أحادي على نقل أسلحة إلى عشيرة أبو شباب. يقود أبو شباب مجموعة تُعرّف نفسها باسم ""القوات الشعبية"" أو ""اللجان الشعبية"" في شرق رفح، وترفع شعارات تؤكد أنها تتولى حماية المساعدات وتنفذ مهام مدنية متعددة في المدينة. كما تقول إنها تدافع عن الناس مما يصفه أبو شباب بـ""ظلم"" حركة حماس. ووفقاً لتقارير إعلامية ، كان أبو شباب سجيناً لدى حماس قبل اندلاع الحرب في غزة في أكتوبر /تشرين الأول 2023. وبينما لا توجد أرقام دقيقة عن أعداد أفراد مجموعة أبو شباب، يقدر عدد المنتمين لها بنحو 300 شخص، وفقاً لصحيفة ""تايمز أوف إسرائيل"" وفي 2 يوليو/ تموز 2025، قالت وزارة الداخلية التابعة لحماس في غزة إن أبو شباب مطالب بتسليم نفسه بتهمة ""الخيانة"" بموجب قرار اتخذته ما سمّته حماس بالـ""محكمة الثورية"" ومنحته مهلة 10 أيام لتسليم نفسه. كما انتشرت تقارير بشأن علاقة بعض الأفراد المنتمين للسلطة الفلسطينية بأبو شباب، وهو ما جاء على لسان أبو شباب نفسه في لقاء مع وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية قال فيه إن ""علاقتنا مع السلطة قائمة على المصلحة الوطنية العليا للشعب الفلسطيني وضمن شرعيتها القانونية"". الأمر الذي نفاه اللواء أنور رجب، الناطق الرسمي باسم قوى الأمن الفلسطيني لبي بي سي نيوز عربي، قائلاً ""إن الأجهزة الأمنية لا علاقة لها بأي تشكيلات عسكرية، وإنها تعمل عبر أذرعها في قطاع غزة بتعليمات القيادة السياسية، وقادة الأمن بوسائلها وأساليبها الخاصة بما يخدم المصلحة العامة"". صدر الصورة،Facebook يقود هذه المجموعة حسام الأسطل، وهو ضابط سابق في الجهاز الوقائي التابع للسلطة الفلسطينية. كانت قد اعتقلته حركة حماس مرات عدة، وحكم عليه بالإعدام بعد اتهامه بقتل أحد أعضاء الحركة في ماليزيا عام 2018. وتمكن الأسطل من الفرار بعد اندلاع الحرب بشهرين. تتهمه حماس أيضاً بـ""العمالة"" والتعاون مع إسرائيل، وقد أقر بالتعاون معها لا التنسيق المباشر، مشيراً إلى أن مقتل ابنته الحامل في غارة إسرائيلية يبرهن عدم تعاونه مع إسرائيل. ويلقي الأسطل اللوم على حماس التي ""تتخفى في بيوت الفلسطينيين"" على حد قوله. وفي مقابلة حصرية مع قناة سكاي نيوز البريطانية في 25 تشرين الأول/أكتوبر، قال الأسطل إن مهمته، إلى جانب المجموعات المسلحة الأخرى المناوئة لحماس – ومن بينها مجموعات أبو شباب ورامي حلس وأشرف المنسي – هي تأسيس ما وصفه بـ""غزة الجديدة""، مشيراً إلى أن هذه الجماعات تعتزم الاتحاد قريباً ""لتحقيق السيطرة الكاملة على قطاع غزة والاجتماع ""تحت مظلة واحدة"". تسمي مجموعة الأسطل نفسها ""القوة الضاربة لمكافحة الإرهاب"" التي تدعي أنها قوة بديلة عن حماس في مناطق جنوب غزة و تتمركز في قرية قيزان النجار في جنوب خان يونس، ويرجح أن عدد أفرادها لا يتجاوز 40 شخصاً. ويقول الأسطل إن معظم أسلحة مجموعته من بنادق كلاشينكوف، يتم شراؤها من مقاتلين سابقين في حماس عبر السوق السوداء. وبينما لا يُعرف الكثير عن مصير الأسطل ومجموعته في الوقت الراهن، تشير تقارير إلى أنهم ما زالوا متمركزين في مناطق نفوذهم السابقة، التي لا تزال تشهد نشاطاً للقوات الإسرائيلية. ووفقاً لتقرير شبكة سكاي نيوز البريطانية، تتمركز المجموعة على طريق عسكري يمتد على طول الخط الأصفر، ويقع على بُعد أقل من 700 متر من أقرب موقع للجيش الإسرائيلي. صدر الصورة،Facebook هي إحدى المجموعات المسلحة المعارضة لحماس، التي تعرف تفسها على أنها ""الجيش الشعبي"". تتألف من نحو 20 شخصاً ويعتقد أنها تأسست في سبتمبر /أيلول الماضي بزعامة أشرف المنسي. ظهر المنسي لاحقاً في مقطع مصور نفى فيه تعرّض مجموعته لأي استهداف، وقال إن ما يتردد في ""الإعلام الحمساوي الإرهابي حول اعتقال وقتل عناصرنا...هي أخبار لا أساس لها وعارية عن الصحة"". كما حذّر المنسي في المقطع مقاتلي حركة حماس من الاقتراب لما وصفها ""بمنطقة سيطرتنا"" مشيراً إلى مناطق في شمال غزة تسيطر عليها مجموعته، وقال إنه ""سيتم التعامل معهم، كما عاملت حركة حماس عناصرنا على أنهم عملاء وخارج الصف الوطني الفلسطيني"". وخاطب سكان غزة في المقطع كذلك قائلاً إن مجموعته تؤكد لهم حمايتهم و""توفير سبل الحياة الكريمة لهم"" مشيراً إلى أنه ""لا وجود لعناصر حماس"" في شمال غزة. صدر الصورة،Facebook تتركز مجموعة حلس، بقيادة رامي حلس، في حي الشجاعية شرق غزة، وتُعد أيضاً من التشكيلات المسلحة المعارضة لحماس. كان حلس موظفاً عسكرياً ضمن جهاز أمن الرئاسة الفلسطينية الذي ينتمي لإحدى العشائر الكبيرة. وذكرت وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية اسم حلس – الذي قالت إنه ينتمي لحركة فتح- من بين الجماعات التي تتعاون مع إسرائيل في غزة. وعن هذه المجموعة أيضاً، نفى اللواء أنور رجب أي علاقة للسلطة الفلسطينية بها. وقال: ""نؤكد أن الأجهزة الأمنية تعمل بكل جهد لمنع الانزلاق نحو اقتتال داخلي، وتخفيف المعاناة عن أهلنا في القطاع ما استطعنا إلى ذلك سبيلا"". وتشير تقارير صحفية إلى أن مجموعة حلس اشتبكت خلال الأيام الماضية بشكل مباشر مع عناصر من كتائب القسام في حي الشجاعية، بينما لا يزال مصير حلس مجهولاً حتى الآن. ساهمت في إعداد هذا التقرير: توبة خليفي"
BBC,en,arabic_general,"تساعد حركات بسيطة على كرسي المكتب من تخفيف آلام أسفل الظهر، تسمى بـ""رقصة السالسا الجالسة""، حيث تؤدي إلى تحريك الحوض للأمام والخلف كما في حركات رقصة السالسا التقليدية. صدر الصورة،Getty Images تُعد آلام أسفل الظهر حالة مزمنة تؤثر على مئات الملايين من الناس حول العالم. لكن هناك تمرين بسيط قد يُساعد كثيراً. أنت تعرف هذا الشعور، عندما تنحني لربط حذائك وتشعر بألم حادّ في أسفل ظهرك. فجأة، تُصبح جزءاً من إحصائية مُذهلة، لقد انضممت إلى ما يُقدر بـ 619 مليون شخص حول العالم يُعانون من ألم أسفل الظهر. ولحسن الحظ، هناك تمرين عملي يُمكن أن يُساعدك، يُسمى ""رقصة السالسا الجالسة"". وما هو أفضل من ذلك؟ أنك لستَ مُضطراً حتى للنهوض من المكتب لممارسته. ويُعد ألم أسفل الظهر السبب الرئيسي للإعاقة في حميع أنحاء العالم. ويُعرّف بأنه ألم بين الحافة السفلية للأضلاع والأرداف. يُمكن أن يُصيب هذا الألم أي شخص، ولكنه أكثر شيوعاً لدى الأشخاص الذين يُعانون من زيادة الوزن، أو المدخنين، أو من لديهم تاريخ عائلي لهذه الحالة. ويقول كريس مكارثي، أستاذ العلاج الطبيعي المُشارك في جامعة مانشستر متروبوليتان: ""عندما كنتُ أعمل مع جراحي العمود الفقري، وجدت أن المناطق التي يُعاني فيها الناس من معظم المشاكل في الظهر، هي الفقرتان السفليتان في العمود الفقري"". ويتكون العمود الفقري من 33 فقرة، تفصل كل فقرة منها طبقة غضروفية إسفنجية تُسمى القرص. وتعمل هذه الأقراص على امتصاص الصدمات أثناء الأنشطة اليومية كالمشي والجري والقفز. صدر الصورة،Getty Images الفقرتان السفليتان، حيث يقع معظم ألم أسفل الظهر، متصلتان بالحوض بأربطة سميكة جداً. هذا يُثبّتهما في مكانهما بإحكام، مما يسمح لهما بأداء وظيفتهما في دعم وزن الجذع. ومع ذلك، هناك جانبٌ سلبي. يقول مكارثي: ""إنه جزء متيبس جداً من الظهر، ويصعب تحريكه، خاصة عندما تكون العضلات الموضعية في حالة تشنج بسبب الألم، أو مشدودة بسبب قلة الحركة"". وتعد إحدى الطرق الجيدة لتمرين عضلات هذه المنطقة هي تدوير الحوض من جانب إلى آخر، ما يجعل أسفل الظهر يميل من جانب إلى آخر في حركة تشبه التأرجح. هذا التأرجح يحدث بشكل طبيعي عند المشي، ولكن، عندما يعاني الشخص من ألم أسفل الظهر، تتشنج عضلات الظهر وتُثبّت المنطقة، يمنعها من الحركة. ويقول مكارثي: ""للأسف، هذا يُدخلنا في حلقة مفرغة حيث يصبح أسفل الظهر أكثر تيبساً، وألماً أكثر فأكثر"". وتُشير الدراسات إلى أنه عندما يتعلق الأمر بآلام الظهر، يُمكن أن تكون الحركة جزءاً أساسياً من عملية الشفاء. عادةً ما يُمكن تحقيق ذلك من خلال الرياضة وتمارين التمدد والعلاج اليدوي. لكن معظم تمارين التمدد المُوصى بها لآلام الظهر لا تُمرّن الجزء السفلي من الظهر. وهنا يأتي دور ""رقصة السالسا الجالسة"". ولأداء التمرين، اجلس بشكل مستقيم مع تثبيت قدميك على الأرض. ضم ساقيك بحيث يكون فخذاك متوازيين. ثم، مع الحفاظ على ثبات كتفيك تماماً، ادفع ركبتك اليمنى للأمام مع سحب ركبتك اليسرى للخلف. ثم بدّل الوضع بحيث تتقدم ركبتك اليسرى وتتراجع ركبتك اليمنى للخلف. يجب أن يتدحرج حوضك للأمام من جانب وللخلف من الجانب الآخر، تماماً كما في رقصة السالسا التقليدية. كرر هذه الحركة لمدة دقيقة واحدة. صدر الصورة،Getty Images ويقول مكارثي: ""يقوم حوضك بحركة اهتزازية خفيفة، وهذا ما يُفترض أن يفعله أثناء المشي"". وقد أجرى مكارثي وزملاؤه في وحدة الحركة في جامعة مانشستر الطبية، وهي وحدة للعلاج الطبيعي، دراسة تجريبية لم تُنشر بعد، طلبوا خلالها من مرضى يعانون من آلام أسفل الظهر أداء رقصة السالسا جالسين مع توصيلهم بمجسّات تخطيط كهربية للعضلات (EMG)، التي تقيس مدى شد عضلات الظهر. وأظهرت النتائج أن دقيقة واحدة فقط من رقصة السالسا جالساً كل 30 دقيقة كانت كافية لاسترخاء عضلاتهم، مما يخفف من أعراض آلام الظهر. ويضيف مكارثي: ""الجميل في الأمر أنه من السهل جداً القيام به أثناء العمل. فأنت لستَ مضطراً حتى للنهوض من المكتب"". وغالباً ما يقضي موظفو المكاتب فترات طويلة من يومهم جالسين، مما يزيد من خطر الإصابة بآلام أسفل الظهر. إن الوقوف والمشي أكثر، حتى لو كان لمجرد شرب الماء، يمكن أن يساعد في تقليل هذا الخطر. ومع ذلك، قد يكون النهوض من المكتب أمراً صعباً في بعض الأحيان. ويؤكد مكارثي: ""إذا كان الموظفون منشغلون بعمل معيّن ولا يستطيعون النهوض من المكتب والتحرك، فيمكنهم بدلاً من ذلك، ممارسة القليل من ""رقصة السالسا الجالسة"" لمدة دقيقة كل نصف ساعة"". وقد يكون هذا التمرين مفيداً أيضاً لكبار السن الذين لا يستطيعون الوقوف والجلوس بسهولة، أو لمن يعانون من صعوبة في الحركة بعد إجراء عملية جراحية. حيث تُظهر الأبحاث أن الحركة المستمرة وممارسة الرياضة بانتظام أمرٌ أساسي لحياة طويلة وصحية. ويقول جوغديب ديسي، استشاري طب الشيخوخة ورئيس الجمعية البريطانية لطب الشيخوخة: ""نعلم أن الكثير من كبار السن لا يمارسون نشاطاً بدنياً كافياً"". وأضاف ""إذا لم تكن قادراً على الحركة بشكل صحيح، فإن تمارين الجلوس طريقة جيدة لبناء القوة. ولكن إذا كنت قادراً، فهناك الكثير مما يمكن القيام به. سواء كان الوقوف على ساق واحدة أثناء تنظيف أسنانك، أو أداء تمرين القرفصاء مع الإمساك بظهر الكرسي أثناء غليان الماء. فالأمر كله يتعلق بترسيخ هذه العادة لتصبح قاعدة ثابتة تلتزم بها دائماً""."
BBC,en,arabic_general,"قُتل غولدن مع جندي إسرائيلي آخر هو أورون شاؤول، الذي استعيد جثمانه في وقت سابق من هذا العام، أثناء الحرب الأخيرة. صدر الصورة،AFP via Getty Images أعلنت إسرائيل الأحد تسلمها عبر الصليب الأحمر رفاتاً، قالت حركة حماس إنه يعود للضابط هدار غولدن الذي قُتل في قطاع غزة  عام 2014. ومن المتوقع أن يفحص خبراء الطب الشرعي في إسرائيل الرفات بعد تسلمه وتأكيد ما إذا كان يعود لغولدن أم لا. وفي حال تأكد ذلك، ستكون حماس قد أعادت 24 جثة منذ دخول اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار في قطاع غزة حيز التنفيذ في العاشر من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. وجاء في بيان صادر عن مكتب رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو ""تسلمت إسرائيل، عبر اللجنة الدولية للصليب الأحمر، نعش رهينة مقتول، وتسليمه إلى قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي وجهاز الشاباك داخل قطاع غزة"". وكانت كتائب القسام، الجناح العسكري لحركة حماس، قد أعلنت في وقت سابق الأحد عزمها تسليم رفات غولدن. وقالت كتائب القسام في بيان: ""في إطار صفقة طوفان الأقصى لتبادل الأسرى، ستقوم كتائب الشهيد عز الدين القسام بتسليم جثة الضابط هدار غولدن التي تم العثور عليها ظهر أمس (السبت) في مسار أحد الأنفاق بمخيم يبنا في مدينة رفح جنوب قطاع غزة عند الساعة 14:00 بتوقيت غزة، (12,00 توقيت غرينتش)"". وذكرت تقارير إعلامية إسرائيلية أن إسرائيل سمحت لعناصر من حماس والصليب الأحمر بإجراء عملية بحث السبت في منطقة خاضعة للسيطرة الإسرائيلية في غزة، رغم أن حماس والجيش لم يؤكدا ذلك. قُتل غولدن، وهو ضابط استطلاع في لواء غفعاتي، في قتال وقع في منطقة رفح خلال حرب إسرائيل على غزة عام 2014. كان غولدن حينها يبلغ من العمر 23 عاماً ويعمل عنصراً في وحدة إسرائيلية مكلفة بتحديد أنفاق حماس وتدميرها عندما قُتل في الأول من أغسطس/آب 2014. وقال الجيش الإسرائيلي إن فريقه تعرض لإطلاق نار من مسلحين قتلوه واحتجزوا جثمانه. وقال نتنياهو في اجتماع مجلس الوزراء الأسبوعي الأحد: ""سقط الملازم هدار غولدن في معركة بطولية خلال عملية الجرف الصامد عام 2014. جثمانه اختُطف على يد حماس، التي رفضت طوال هذه الفترة إعادته""، وفق ما نقلت وكالة فرانس برس. يشار إلى أن غولدن كان قد قُتل مع جندي إسرائيلي آخر هو أورون شاؤول، الذي استعيد جثمانه في وقت سابق من هذا العام أثناء الحرب الأخيرة. وفشلت المحاولات السابقة لاستعادة رفات الجنديين من خلال صفقات تبادل الرهائن والسجناء. وأشارت صحيفة جيروساليم بوست الإسرائيلية إلى أن عدداً من المسؤولين الإسرائيليين على مدار تلك السنوات، رفضوا إبرام صفقة مع حماس، حتى لا يتكرر سيناريو صفقة إطلاق سراح الجندي جلعاد شاليط في عام 2011، والتي خرج بموجبها مئات السجناء الفلسطينيين، من بينهم زعيم حماس يحيى السنوار، الذي قتل خلال حرب السابع من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023. أدرجت إسرائيل اسم غولدن ضمن قائمة الرهائن الموتى الذين تسعى إلى استعادة رفاتهم بموجب اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار الذي توسطت فيه الولايات المتحدة لإنهاء الحرب في غزة. وفي بداية الهدنة في العاشر من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، كانت حماس تحتجز عشرين رهينة أحياء و28 جثة لرهائن. وأفرجت حماس منذ ذلك الحين عن جميع الرهائن الأحياء وأعادت 24 جثماناً بموجب اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار. في المقابل، أطلقت إسرائيل سراح نحو ألفي فلسطيني من سجونها، وأعادت جثث مئات الفلسطينيين إلى غزة. وفي حال تأكيد أن الرفات يعود لغولدن، تبقى أربع جثث لرهائن - ثلاثة إسرائيليين وتايلاندي واحد - من المقرر إعادتها من غزة."
BBC,en,arabic_general,"أثار نشر صورة لزوجين يرتديان الجلابية داخل المتحف المصري الكبير نقاشاً واسعاً في مصر حول هوية المصريين وملابسهم بين الماضي والحاضر. وتحول الجدل، الذي بدأ بتعليق من الإعلامية سمر فودة، إلى نقاش أوسع عن الطبقية والريف والهوية الثقافية للمجتمع المصري. صدر الصورة،@Shrooq Elsayed يبدو أن تبعات افتتاح المتحف المصري الكبير تواصل إثارة النقاش على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي في البلاد. فبعد الجدل حول هوية المصريين ومدى ارتباطهم بإرث الحضارة المصرية القديمة، وصل النقاش الآن إلى الملابس وارتباطها بحاضر المصريين وتاريخهم. البداية كانت مع صورة التقطتها المصورة الصحفية شروق السيد لزوجين في المتحف، يرتدي كلٌّ منهما جلباباً تقليدياً (جلابية). وبينما أثنى العديد من المعلقين على الصورة، جاء تعليق من الإعلامية سمر فودة ليثير عاصفة من النقاش. إذ أعادت فودة نشر الصورة على حسابها على موقع فيسبوك، معلقة بالقول إن تلك الملابس ""لا تمثل صورة مصر التي كان رجالها ونساؤها في الأربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن الماضي يرتدون الملابس الأوروبية"". وبعد ذلك المنشور، تعرضت فودة لهجوم كبير، لتحذف بعد ذلك الصورة ""لعدم تفهم الناس وجهة نظرها""، كما اعتذرت عن ""أي شيء مسّ قلوب المصريين بالسلب""، واعتذرت أيضاً ""للزوجين، فهما بالتأكيد فخر لنا جميعاً"". كما شددت على اعتزازها بأصولها الريفية، مشيرة إلى أن والدها كان يرتدي الجلباب الأبيض دائماً. جدير بالذكر أن سمر فودة هي ابنة الكاتب الراحلفرج فودة، الذي اغتيل في تسعينيات القرن الماضي على يد متشددين إسلاميين بسبب كتاباته الداعية للعلمانية. لم ترحب الكثير من وسائل الإعلام المصرية بحديث سمر فودة، إذ انتقد مقدمو برامج حوارية ما قالته، بل وصل الأمر ببعضهم إلى الظهور أمام الكاميرات بالجلباب. وأجرت وسائل إعلام مقابلات مع صاحب الصورة، الذي تحدث عن رحلته من محافظة قنا إلى المتحف صحبة زوجته وابنته، وشعوره في البداية بالغضب نتيجة انتهاك خصوصيته هو وزوجته بسبب انتشار الصورة، قبل أن يتحول ذلك الشعور إلى فرحة كبيرة بسبب التعليقات الكثيرة الداعمة له. كما نقلت وسائل الإعلام انتقادات رسمية لحديث سمر فودة، إذ قالت الدكتورة نهلة إمام، مستشار وزير الثقافة للتراث غير المادي، في تصريحات صحفية إن الزي التقليدي يعكس احترام الهوية الوطنية ويستحق التقدير. صدر الصورة،Getty Images كانت نبرة الانتقادات لحديث سمر فودة أكثر حدة في فضاء مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي بمصر. إذ قام عديد من المعلقين بنشر صورهم وهم يرتدون الجلباب احتجاجاً على ما وصفوه بـ ""النبرة المتعالية"" في الحديث عن مواطنين مصريين. كذلك عقد معلقون مقارنة بين احتفاء دول أجنبية بالزي التقليدي من جهة و""النظرة العنصرية"" لدى البعض حيال لباس أغلبية المصريين. وسرد البعض تجاربهم مع ما وصفوه بـ ""تضييق"" يتعرض له أصحاب الجلابية عند الدخول إلى أماكن عامة كالأندية. كما أشار معلقون إلى أن البيانات تظهر أن أغلب سكان مصر يعيشون في الريف، حيث الجلباب هو الزي الأكثر انتشاراً. أما الحديث عن ملابس أهل مصر في الأربعينيات والخمسينيات فقد أثار أيضاً نقاشاً تاريخياً، إذ أشار فريق من المعلقين إلى أن الحديث عن ""مصر الأوروبية"" يتجاهل حقيقة أن الأغلبية الساحقة من المصريين في تلك الفترة كانت تعيش في الريف وتعاني الفقر المدقع. وكان لافتاً أيضاً الحديث الذي يرى أن صورة الجلابية تعكس أن قطاعات كبيرة من المصريين معتزة بإرثها الفرعوني، رغم الدعاوى المنددة بذلك الإرث والتي تصدر من منطلق ديني. كذلك اعترض البعض على حديث فودة انطلاقاً من مبدأ حرية اللباس، معتبرين أن ""من ينتقد الجلابية لا يختلف عن من يهاجم من تخلع الحجاب"". وجاء النقاش حول ملابس المصريين بعد أيام من جدل إلكتروني آخر حول الهوية المصرية. فمع افتتاح المتحف الكبير بالجيزة، قام العديد من رواد مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي بنشر صور لهم معدلة بتقنيات الذكاء الاصطناعي تُظهرهم مرتدين زي الفراعنة. وأعادت موجة الصور الفرعونية تلك الجدل حول الهوية المصرية: هل هي مستمدة من إرث قدماء المصريين، أم أن المكون الإسلامي هو الغالب؟ كما أثار الحديث عن إرث الفراعنة نقاشاً حول واقع المصريين اليوم، ""الذين يعانون من الفقر"" رغم انتمائهم إلى حضارة من أقدم حضارات العالم."
BBC,en,arabic_general,"في جولة الصحافة لهذا اليوم، نتناول دعوة لحزب العمال البريطاني إلى أن يستلهم تجربة السياسي الأمريكي زهران ممداني ويتحرّر من خوفه ويتبنّى إصلاحات جذرية تعيد الثقة باليسار، كذلك نسلط الضوء على النساء السود وما يتعرضهم لهن اليوم من تمييز في سوق العمل الأمريكي، وحديث حول تصريحات الممثلة جينيفر لورنس عن حدود تأثير الفنانين في السياسة. صدر الصورة،Getty Images في جولة الصحافة لهذا اليوم، نستعرض مقالاً يوجّه دعوة موجهة لحزب العمال البريطاني بالاستفادة من تجربة السياسي الأمريكي زهران ممداني والتحرّر من الخوف وتبنّي إصلاحات جذرية تعيد الثقة باليسار، كذلك نسلط الضوء على مقال يركز على ما تتعرض له النساء السود هذه الأيام من تمييز في سوق العمل الأمريكي، وحديث في مقال ثالث حول تصريحات الممثلة جينيفر لورنس حول حدود تأثير الفنانين في السياسة. نبدأ من مقال النائبة البريطانية عن حزب العمال ناديا ويتوم، الذي نشرته في صحيفة الإندبندنت بعنوان ""حزب العمال بحاجة إلى تجربة على غرار ممداني"". وأشارت ويتوم إلى أن نجاح زهران ممداني وفوزه بمنصب عمدة مدينة نيويورك لم يكن فقط بسبب قدرته الخطابية وحملته الميدانية، بل لأنه قدّم برنامجاً ديمقراطياً اشتراكياً ركّز على أزمة المعيشة، وفرض الضرائب على الأثرياء، وإعادة توزيع الثروة. وأكدت ويتوم أن هذه السياسات تحظى بشعبية واسعة في بريطانيا أيضاً، داعية حزب العمال إلى تبنّي سياسات جريئة بدلاً من الاكتفاء بإصلاحات شكلية لا تمس جوهر الأزمة الاقتصادية. وقالت إن 75 في المئة من البريطانيين يؤيدون فرض ضريبة ثروة بنسبة 1 في المئة على الأصول التي تتجاوز 10 ملايين جنيه إسترليني (نحو 13 مليون دولار)، و2 في المئة على الأصول التي تتجاوز ملياراً. ولفتت إلى أن الحزب الحاكم، رغم أغلبيته البرلمانية، يبدو عالقاً في سياسة دفاعية بدلاً من التقدّم بإصلاحات اقتصادية حقيقية، محذّرة من أن مطاردة أصوات حزب ""ريفورم"" اليميني أدّت إلى ""سباق نحو القاع"" في قضايا الهجرة وحقوق الأقليات. صدر الصورة،Getty Images وأضافت أن حملة ممداني كانت نموذجاً مغايراً، إذ تناولت قضايا مثل غزة، وحقوق العابرين جنسياً، والهجرة بجرأة وثقة، وواجهت الهجمات السياسية بأسلوب تفاعلي جذب الناخبين. وأشارت الكاتبة إلى خطاب ممداني المؤثر عن الاستهداف الذي تعرض له بسبب هويته المسلمة، معتبرة أنه عبّر عن واقع الأقليات المضطهدة في نيويورك، ومؤكدة أن تصاعد اليمين المتطرف في العالم يتطلّب من التقدميين شجاعة في الدفاع عن المساواة ورفض الكراهية. وقالت ويتوم إن حزب العمال بحاجة إلى ""لحظته الممدانية الخاصة""، لكنه ""يُخنق"" حالياً من قبل آليات حزبية غير ديمقراطية، إذ يُستبعد المرشحون اليساريون من القوائم، كما حدث مع فايزة شاهين وموريس ماكلاود وغريغ مارشال. ونوّهت إلى أن النظام الأمريكي، رغم عيوبه، يسمح من خلال الانتخابات التمهيدية بصعود شخصيات مثل ممداني وألكساندريا أوكاسيو كورتيز، بينما يحرم الحزب البريطاني أعضاءه من اختيار مرشحيهم بحرية. وقالت إن أمام الحكومة فرصة أخيرة، قبل إعلان الموازنة المقبلة، لإثبات انحيازها للطبقة العاملة من خلال إصلاح ضريبي يطال الثروات الكبرى، محذّرة من أن تحميل الأعباء للطبقات العاملة سيقوّض ثقة الناخبين. واستشهدت بتقديرات منظمة ""تاكس جستاس يو كي"" التي تشير إلى أن فرض ضرائب عادلة على الأثرياء والشركات الكبرى يمكن أن يدرّ نحو 60 مليار جنيه سنوياً لتمويل الخدمات العامة وإنقاذ المجتمعات المحلية. وبينت أن ""اقتصاداً يزداد فيه ثراء العائلات الخمسين الأغنى بينما تتراجع أجور الناس العاديين لا يمكن أن يستمر""، مضيفة أن حزب العمال سيخسر إذا استمر في تجاهل واقع عدم المساواة، وأن استعادة ثقة الناخبين تمرّ عبر تبنّي سياسات حقيقية تعالج أزمة المعيشة، وتدافع في الوقت ذاته عن التنوع والحقوق التي تتعرّض لهجوم متزايد من اليمين المتطرف، وفقاً للمقال. إلى صحيفة يو أس إيه توديه ومقال مشترك للكاتبين يُهورو ويليامز وشيري آر. كاري، بعنوان: ""النساء السود هن العمود الفقري للقوى العاملة... فلماذا يتعرّضن لمزيد من فقدان الوظائف؟"". ويتحدث الكاتبان في المقال عن عمل النساء السود في الولايات المتحدة، وأنهن ""دائماً ما كن مرئيات بما يكفي للقيام بالعمل، لكنهن غير مرئيات عندما يتعلّق الأمر بالسلطة أو الحماية أو التقدير"". واستعاد الكاتبان تجربة قديمة لأحدهما في تدريب داخل وكالة فدرالية عام 1993، حين عُلق على وجود عدد كبير من النساء السود بعبارة مهينة تعتبر ذلك ""استيفاءً لمتطلّبات التنوع""، وهي لحظة - كما قالا - تلخّص حقيقة تاريخية عن العمل في الولايات المتحدة. وأوضح الكاتبان أنّ ما تواجهه النساء السود اليوم من تسريح واسع من الوظائف الفدرالية يعيد إنتاج تاريخ طويل من التمييز والتقليل من القيمة، ويشيران إلى أنهن في الفترة ما بين فبراير/شباط وأبريل/نيسان خسرن أكثر من 300 ألف وظيفة، رغم أن معدل البطالة العام في البلاد لم يتغيّر كثيراً، ما يعكس عمق الفجوة البنيوية. صدر الصورة،Getty Images وأشارا إلى أنّ النساء السود يشكّلن نحو 12 في المئة من موظفي الحكومة الفدرالية، مقارنة بـ 6 في المئة فقط من مجمل القوى العاملة الأمريكية، وأنهن يتمركزن في القطاعات الأكثر تضرراً من التخفيضات، مثل التعليم والصحة والإسكان. ويقولان إن وزارة التعليم وحدها – التي خفّضت 46 في المئة من طاقمها – شغلت النساء السود فيها 28 في المئة من الوظائف. وأضاف المقال أنّ هؤلاء النساء يؤدين أدواراً أساسية غير مرئية، فهنّ من يحافظن على استمرارية عمل الدولة والمجتمعات السوداء، من الكنائس إلى الجمعيات المحلية، وحين يفقدن وظائفهن، تتأثّر أسرٌ ومؤسسات بأكملها. ولفت الكاتبان إلى أنّ هذا النمط ليس جديداً، إذ لطالما حُصرت النساء السود في قطاعات منخفضة الأجر كالتعليم والرعاية الصحية والخدمة العامة، فيما ظلّت الفجوتان العرقية والجندرية قائمتين في بنية الاقتصاد الأمريكي. وأكد المقال أنّ عمليات التسريح الحالية كشفت مجدداً عن هذه الاختلالات الهيكلية، داعياً إلى رؤية النساء السود ليس كضحايا اقتصاديين، بل كدليل على استمرار المجتمع في التقليل من قيمة من ينهضون به فعلاً. ودعا الكاتبان أرباب العمل إلى تحمّل مسؤوليتهم في مواجهة هذا التمييز من خلال الاحتفاظ بالموظفات المتضررات وتوفير فرص تدريب وترقية وعدالة في الأجور، وإنشاء مسارات تقود النساء السود من الأدوار الداعمة إلى مواقع صنع القرار. وقالا إنّ سقوط النساء السود يضعف المجتمعات ويُنهك الأمة، لكن الاستثمار في قوتهنّ وصلابتهنّ يرفع الجميع، وفقاً للمقال. إلى مجلة بلومبرغ ومقال للكاتب جيسون بيلي بعنوان: ""جينيفر لورنس محقّة بشأن السياسة في هوليوود"" إذ يتحدث فيها عن الممثلة الأميركية جينيفر لورنس، التي تروّج حالياً لفيلمها النفسي الجديد ""مت يا حبيبي""، مشيراً إلى أن حديثها أثار نقاشاً أعمق من مجرّد الحديث عن السينما، بعد تصريحاتها حول دور الفنانين في التعبير السياسي وحدود تأثيرهم الحقيقي. وأوضح بيلي أن لورنس ليست غريبة عن التعبير السياسي، إذ قالت لصحيفة نيويورك تايمز إنها شعرت خلال ولاية ترامب الأولى بأنها ""تجري بلا هدف كدجاجة قُطع رأسها""، مضيفة أنها كانت تهاجم الرئيس علناً لكنها تساءلت لاحقاً عمّا إذا كان لذلك جدوى. ويقتبس الكاتب من تعليقها بالقول: ""لقد تعلّمنا، انتخاباً بعد آخر، أن المشاهير لا يغيّرون نتيجة التصويت. فماذا أفعل إذاً؟ أضيف الوقود إلى نار تمزّق البلاد؟"". وأشار الكاتب إلى أن هذا السؤال ""فماذا أفعل إذاً؟"" يجب أن يطرحه كل فنان في هوليوود يسعى إلى إحداث أثر حقيقي، خصوصاً في زمن أصبحت فيه الشهرة بحد ذاتها مفهوماً مختلفاً، بعد أن صار المؤثرون عبر وسائل التواصل والبودكاست يمتلكون تأثيراً يفوق نجوم السينما التقليديين، بل ويُعتقد أنهم ساعدوا الرئيس دونالد ترامب في الفوز بولاية ثانية. وأضاف بيلي أن لورنس عبّرت عن رغبتها في ألا تُنفّر الجمهور من أعمالها الفنية بسبب مواقفها السياسية، مؤكدة أنها لا تريد أن ""تصرف الناس عن أفلام يمكن أن تغيّر الوعي أو العالم، فقط لأنهم لا يحبّون آرائي السياسية"". ويرى الكاتب أن هذا الموقف لا يعكس حسابات تجارية بقدر ما يقدّم رؤية ذكية لكيفية تمرير الرسائل السياسية من خلال الفن نفسه، لا عبر تصريحات الفنانين. صدر الصورة،Getty Images وأشار إلى أن أفلاماً كثيرة قدّمت رسائل سياسية أو اجتماعية عميقة دون أن تُسوّق نفسها على هذا الأساس، مثل فيلم ""معركة تلو أخرى"" الذي اعتُبر الأكثر سياسية هذا العام، لكنه رُوّج له على أنه فيلم أكشن جماهيري، فشاهد الجمهور العمل دون أن يشعر بأنه بيان سياسي، ما سمح له بالتأثير بشكل أوسع. كما ذكّر الكاتب بأن التاريخ السينمائي مليء بأمثلة على الرسائل السياسية المضمّنة داخل أفلام الترفيه، مثل ""إنهم يعيشون"" المناهض للرأسمالية، و""نادي القتال"" الذي ينتقد الاستهلاك، و""المصفوفة"" الذي يتضمّن أبعاداً عن الهوية والتحرر، و""اخرج"" الذي تناول العنصرية في حقبة ما بعد أوباما. وأوضح أن الكوميديا ""مذيع الأخبار""، التي صدرت عام 2004، كانت في الأصل ردّاً على سياسات إدارة جورج بوش الابن، رغم أنها بدت للوهلة الأولى مجرد فيلم ساخر خفيف، ومع مرور الوقت أثّرت في نظرة الجمهور إلى أصحاب السلطة المتغطرسين. وقال بيلي إن التعبير السياسي عبر الفن نفسه ليس ضمانة لتغيير القناعات، لكنه يبقى وسيلة أكثر فاعلية من الخطابات المباشرة، لأن الأعمال الفنية القوية والمشحونة بالرمزية قادرة على عكس الحالة الوطنية والتأثير فيها بعمق وإن بشكل غير مباشر، وفقاً للمقال."
BBC,en,arabic_general,"إذا نجحت شركة في تصميم جناح مُدمج بشكل صحيح، فإنهم يجادلون بأن أبحاث وكالة الفضاء الأمريكية (ناسا) تُشير إلى أن ذلك قد يُقلل استهلاك الوقود بنسبة تصل إلى 50 في المئة باستخدام أحدث التقنيات، ويُقلل الانبعاثات بنسبة مُماثلة، ويُخفض الضوضاء بنسبة كبيرة. صدر الصورة،Outbound مفهوم الطائرات ذات الأجنحة المدمجة - حيث يتشكَّل جسم الطائرة والأجنحة في بنية انسيابية واحدة - ليس جديداً. لكن هذا التصميم الثوري قد يُصبح قريباً مفهوماً موثوقاً به لطائرات الركاب. في مارس/ آذار 2025، أقلعت طائرة صغيرة على شكل حرف V، تعمل بالتحكم عن بُعد، لأول مرة من ميدان تجارب ""بيندلتون"" للطائرات بدون طيار، في شرق ولاية أوريغون الأمريكية. سُمّيت الطائرة بدون طيار ""ستيف"" (اختصار للكلمات الإنجليزية التي تعني مركبة الاختبار المُصغرة)، وحلقت لمدة 16 ثانية فقط في رحلتها الأولى، لكن ذلك لم يُحدث فرقاً. كانت رحلة الطائرة ""ستيف"" الأولى والرحلات اللاحقة بمثابة الخطوات الأولى، على طريق مسعى شركة Outbound Aerospace (أوت باونك إيروسبيس)، مُبتكرة الطائرة، إلى أن يؤدي ذلك إلى إطلاق طائرة ركاب جديدة وثورية ذات أجنحة مدمجة، تتسع لنحو ما بين 200 إلى 250 مقعداً في ثلاثينيات القرن الحادي والعشرين. بجناحين يبلغ طولهما 52 متراً، أي ما يعادل ثمانية أضعاف طول جناحي ستيف، وهي طائرة سُميت بالفعل ""أولمبيك"". تعود فكرة دمج أجنحة وجسم الطائرة بسلاسة، دون أي خط فاصل واضح، بهدف زيادة الكفاءة الديناميكية الهوائية (تقليل مقاومة الهواء لجسم الطائرة أثناء الطيران)، إلى أكثر من 100 عام. في عام 1924، قامت أول طائرة مُسجلة بأجنحة مُدمجة برحلتها الأولى، ثم تحطمت. ومنذ ذلك الحين، تُركت مهمة تطوير تقنية الأجنحة المُدمجة في المقام الأول في يد الجيش الأمريكي لتطويرها لقاذفاته. والآن، قد تعني الحاجة المُلحة من قبل صناعة الطيران لخفض الانبعاثات أن الوقت قد حان لظهور أول طائرة ركاب تجارية بأجنحة مُدمجة. ولكن هل تستطيع الشركات الناشئة مثل Outbound Aerospace ""أوت باوند إيروسبيس"" التغلب على التحديات الجسيمة المتبقية؟. صدر الصورة،Getty Images تهدف رحلات الطائرة ستيف إلى إظهار أعمال تصميم الطائرات المدمجة المبتكرة - التي تقدمها الشركة الناشئة، ومقرها في مدينة سياتل الأمريكية -، وأن تقنية التصنيع ""المبتكرة"" التي تقدمها الشركة قادرة على إنتاج هذا النوع الجديد من طائرات الركاب متوسطة الحجم، بشكل أسرع وأرخص من شركات صناعة الطائرات الكبرى الحالية، مثل إيرباص وبوينغ. يقول جيك أرمينتا، مهندس سابق في بوينغ، والمؤسس المشارك والرئيس التنفيذي للتكنولوجيا في شركة أوت باوند إيروسبيس: ""لقد انتقلنا من تصميم جديد كلياً إلى نموذج تجريبي في حوالي 12 شهراً"". ويعتقد أرمينتا أن فريقه أثبت قدرته على اختصار المدة، التي قد تستغرقها عملية تطوير طائرة تجارية، التي تتراوح بين 5 و10 سنوات أو أكثر. ويضيف: ""حلّقت الطائرة لأول مرة بعد تسعة أشهر بالضبط، من اليوم الذي افتتحنا فيه أبواب مصنعنا لأول مرة"". والآن، يُستخدم منتجهم التكنولوجي كطائرة شحن بدون طيار، إذ ""أثبتت الطائرة ستيف جدارتها بجذب اهتمام وزارة الدفاع الأمريكية، وغيرها من العملاء المدنيين، بفضل مساحة الشحن الواسعة التي توفرها، وكونها أقل تكلفة من التصاميم التقليدية. لذا، فهي أول منتج نطرحه في السوق حالياً"". يضيف آرون بويسن، مدير تطوير الأعمال في أوت باوند: ""نعتقد أنه بإمكاننا خفض الوقت وتكاليف رأس المال لتطوير هذه الطائرات بشكل كبير، إلا أن التكلفة ستظل باهظة. علينا تحقيق إيرادات قبل مرور عشر سنوات من الآن"". على الرغم من تشكيك المستثمرين في جدوى خططهم، تمكنت شركة أوت باوند من جمع حوالي مليون دولار كتمويل تمهيدي حتى الآن. ويُعد هذا التمويل أول استثمار تتلقاه شركة ناشئة لتحويل أفكارها إلى واقع ملموس، ما سمح لها بتوظيف خمسة موظفين بدوام كامل ومتعاقدين وموظفين بدوام جزئي حسب الحاجة. أوت باوند ليست الشركة الوحيدة التي تسلك هذا الطريق. فهناك شركتان ناشئتان أخريان على الأقل في سباق بناء أول طائرة ركاب بأجنحة مدمجة، وهو ما كان ""هدفاً طويل الأمد لدرجة أن البعض يقول إنه أصبح الكأس المقدسة (الجائزة الكبرى) في عالم الطيران'""، كما يقول المحلل والمعلق بيل سويتمان. صدر الصورة،Outbound تبدو الصور الحاسوبية اللامعة، التي تُصوّر كيف قد تبدو الطائرة ""أولمبيك"" في ثلاثينيات القرن الحادي والعشرين، مختلفة تماماً عن طائرات الركاب ذات الأنبوب والأجنحة التي تنتجها بوينغ وإيرباص حالياً. تُسمى هذه الطائرات غالباً بالأجنحة الطائرة، وهي أكثر كفاءةً من الناحية الديناميكية الهوائية من الطائرات التقليدية. إذا نجحت شركة في تصميم جناح مُدمج بشكل صحيح، فإنهم يجادلون بأن أبحاث وكالة الفضاء الأمريكية (ناسا) تُشير إلى أنها قد تُقلل استهلاك الوقود بنسبة تصل إلى 50 في المئة باستخدام أحدث التقنيات، وتُقلل الانبعاثات بنسبة مُماثلة، وتُقلل الضوضاء بنسبة كبيرة، وتُحقق ذلك بمقصورات قد تكون أكبر بنسبة 40 في المئة، ونتيجة لذلك، قد يكون من الممكن فتح طرق جوية جديدة. وبينما ستكون المقاعد القريبة من النوافذ محدودة، فقد تكون هناك مساحة كافية لأبواب كبيرة جداً تُغني عن طوابير الانتظار البطيئة للصعود، بالإضافة إلى توفير مقصورات مُنفصلة لركاب الدرجة الأولى ورجال الأعمال والدرجة السياحية. لدى بعض دعاة إعادة النظر الجذرية في الطائرات التجارية طموحات أكبر. إنهم يأملون أن تفتح شركات ناشئة مثل أوت باوند ومنافسيها مثل JetZero وNautilus سوق الطائرات لتصاميم جديدة، غير تلك الصادرة عن إيرباص أو بوينغ، ملقيين باللوم على هذا الاحتكار الثنائي في خنق الأفكار الجديدة في هذه الصناعة. يبدو أن JetZero ""جيت زيرو"" تتمتع بأحد أعلى المراكز، بين جميع الشركات الناشئة، في السباق لتطوير أول طائرة ركاب تجارية كاملة الحجم ذات أجنحة مدمجة من نموذج تكنولوجي تجريبي صغير الحجم. حصلت شركة ""جيت زيرو""، ومقرها في مدينة لونغ بيتش في ولاية كاليفورنيا، على تمويل بقيمة 235 مليون دولار من القوات الجوية الأمريكية، بالإضافة إلى استثمارات إضافية من شركتي يونايتد إيرلاينز وألاسكا إيرلاينز لتمويل تطوير طائرتها Z4. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، لدى شركة يونايتد إيرلاينز فرصة لطلب شراء ما يصل إلى 200 طائرة Z4، إذا استوفت تلك الطائرة متطلبات شركات الطيران. كما تعاونت شركة ""جيت زيرو"" مع شركات طيران بارزة، بما في ذلك BAE وNorthrup Grumman وشركة تصنيع محركات الطائرات Pratt & Whitney، لتطوير طائرة Z4. وقد حلقت بالفعل بطائرتها التجريبية الصغيرة Pathfinder I، وأكملت مراجعة التصميم النهائية. تُعدّ هذه المراجعة تقييماً رسمياً للتصميم النهائي لتقييم جاهزيته للتصنيع. قُبيل انطلاق معرض باريس الجوي في يونيو/ حزيران 2025، أعلنت ""جيت زيرو"" اختيارها موقع مصنعها لبناء طائرة Z4. يقع المصنع في مدينة غرينزبورو، بولاية كارولاينا الشمالية في الولايات المتحدة، بجوار المصنع الذي تبني فيه شركة Boom، وهي شركة ناشئة أخرى في مجال الطيران، طائرتها الأسرع من الصوت، والتي تخطط شركة يونايتد لطلبها إذا استوفت متطلباتها. تخطط ""جيت زيرو"" بطموح لبدء رحلاتها بطائرة تجريبية كاملة الحجم في أوائل عام 2027. صدر الصورة،JetZero لا ينزعج بويسن، من شركة أوت باوند أيروسبيس، من التقدم الواضح لمنافسيه. يقول: ""إن الدعاية حول ""جيت زيرو"" وطلبات الشراء المسبقة لمنتجها تُفيدنا جميعاً، لأنها تُدخل هياكل الطائرات ذات الأجنحة المُدمجة في نقاشات شركات الطيران والصناعة. هذا يعني أنهم سيواجهون تكاليف باهظة للتصديق والقبول العام قبلنا، ولن نضطر إلى تحمل هذه التكاليف الباهظة كما فعلوا"". لطالما كانت تصاميم الأجنحة المُدمجة طموحاً للعديد من مصممي الطائرات منذ بدايات عصر الطيران. يقول بيل سويتمان: ""هناك اهتمام كبير الآن، بسبب حماس المستثمرين المغامرين وخبراء التكنولوجيا للتطوير، وتغيير أكبر عدد ممكن من الصناعات القديمة المُملة، والطيران هو الهدف التالي"". ويضيف: ""لقد ساهمت المواد المتقدمة، والتصميم بمساعدة الحاسوب (CAD) والديناميكا الهوائية ثلاثية الأبعاد، جميعها في تعزيز هذا الاهتمام الجديد بهياكل الطائرات ذات الأجنحة المدمجة... هناك من يرغبون في رؤية منافس جديد لشركتي إيرباص وبوينغ... تكمن المشكلة في التكلفة الباهظة لبدء إنتاج هذا الشيء، وتأسيس شركة جديدة لتصنيع الطائرات التجارية مهمة شاقة للغاية"". لكنه يشكك في جدوى دعم شركات الطيران لهذه المشاريع، على الرغم من التمويل المُعلن عنه حتى الآن. ويضيف سويتمان: ""الأموال التي تخاطر بها شركات الطيران حالياً لا قيمة لها (محدودة للغاية). فالطلبيات التي أعلنت عنها مشروطة بقدرة هذه الشركات الناشئة على تقديم ما تريده شركات الطيران. هذا أشبه بتأثير الهالة الخضراء (التصور الإيجابي عن منتج ما)، إنه يتعلق أكثر بشركات الطيران التي تُعلن عن أفكارها الجديدة"". ومع ذلك، قد يكون البدء بطائرة تجريبية صغيرة الحجم والانتقال إلى طائرة تجريبية كاملة الحجم فكرة جيدة. ""سيبني ذلك ثقة كبيرة. لكن لا يُمكن بناء خط إنتاج لهذه الأشياء ودخولها الخدمة، بمجرد إجراء القليل من الاختبارات عليها حالياً"". صدر الصورة،NASA أول طائرة مُسجلة ذات أجنحة مُدمجة حلقت في الجو هي ""ويستلاند دريدنوت"" عام 1924. بناءً على أفكار التصميم المُستقبلية للمخترع الروسي، نيكولاس وويفودسكي، تحطمت طائرة دريدنوت التي تتسع لثمانية ركاب في أول رحلة لها، بسبب عدم الاستقرار وفقدان السيطرة، ما أدى إلى إصابة طيارها بجروح بالغة، وتم التخلي عنها. ومنذ ذلك الحين، أدى تعقيد تصميم الأجنحة المُدمجة إلى ترك هذا التصور للجيش ليُطوره، مع تصاميم ناجحة مثل  Rockwell B1-B Lancer وB-21 Raider. يقول سويتمان: ""من الصعب جداً الحصول على التصميم الصحيح، بسبب تدفق الهواء المُعقد حول الطائرات ذات الأجنحة المُدمجة... لكن من السهل نسبياً القيام بذلك عند تصميم قاذفة قنابل، لأنها لا تحتوي على مساحات كبيرة مضغوطة في داخلها. وينطبق الأمر نفسه على الناقلات المستخدمة في التزود بالوقود جواً"". على مدار الثلاثين عاماً الماضية، استكشفت ناسا، وبوينغ، وإيرباص، وشركة تصنيع الطائرات الصينية كوماك، وحتى شركة بومباردييه الكندية لتصنيع طائرات رجال الأعمال، تصميمات الأجنحة المدمجة للطيران التجاري. وكثيراً ما قامت فرق البحث التابعة لها بذلك من خلال بناء طائرات اختبار صغيرة الحجم مثل ستيف، واختبارها في أنفاق الرياح، ثم إطلاقها في العالم الحقيقي. ينبع جزء كبير من موجة التصاميم الحالية من دعوة ناسا عام 1988 إلى تصميمات طائرات ثورية. ومن بين الفرق التي استجابت فريق يضم الدكتور روبرت ليباك، الذي أصبح لاحقاً مطوراً مشاركاً ومدير مشروع لبرامج الأجنحة المدمجة في بوينغ. وقد أدى عملهم على طائرة ركاب مستقبلية ذات أجنحة مدمجة في النهاية إلى طائرة يتم التحكم فيها عن بُعد، وهي بوينغ/ناسا إكس-48، والتي اختارتها مجلة تايم كواحدة من أفضل الاختراعات لعام 2007. ربما كانت إكس-48 صغيرة الحجم، لكنها صُممت لتطير كطائرة كاملة الحجم. شرعت طائرتا إكس-48، اللتان بُنيتا بعد ذلك، في سلسلة رائعة من 120 رحلة على مدار ست سنوات. اختبرت هذه الرحلات كيفية استجابة الطائرات ذات الأجنحة المدمجة لمشاكل، مثل تعطل المحركات أو توقفها، بالإضافة إلى استكشاف طرق لتقليل استهلاك الوقود ومستويات الضوضاء. صدر الصورة،JetZero ورغم ذلك، فإن الثورة التي وعدت بها طائرة X-48 لم تنطلق بعد. يقول سويتمان: ""في الماضي، كان بوب ليبيك (عالم ديناميكا هوائية أمريكي) يحاول بجهد كبير التغلب على المشاكل العملية للطائرات ذات الأجنحة المدمجة. ولعل أكبر هذه المشاكل هو الحاجة إلى تركيب مقصورة ركاب مضغوطة فيها"". ويضيف: ""تميل الأوعية المضغوطة إلى أن تكون ذات مقاطع عرضية دائرية، لأن الأسطح المستوية تتعرض لأحمال عالية جداً تحت الضغط، ما يتسبب في تعقيدات هيكلية لأي تصميم يشبه الصندوق. ثم شكلت محاولة صياغة هذا التصميم حول مقصورة جذابة تحدياً إضافياً"". ويقول: ""بعد استحواذ شركة بوينغ على منافستها، شركة ماكدونيل دوغلاس، بدأ ليبيك يفكر في أن طائرة بوينغ التالية يجب أن تكون بتصميم أجنحة مُدمجة بدلاً من طائرة 787. ثم جاءت لجنة تحقيق من سياتل لوضع حد لهذه البدعة"". طائرة ستيف المصنعة من قِبل شركة أوت باوند مُصممة بنفس حجم وأبعاد طائرة X-48 عمداً. يقول بويسن: ""أثبت برنامج X-48 أن أنظمة التحكم الحديثة في الطيران قادرة على إدارة تصميم أجنحة مُدمجة بفعالية. لكن تصنيعها كان لا يزال مكلفاً بسبب التعقيدات"". يقول جيك أرمينتا، الرئيس التنفيذي للتكنولوجيا في شركة أوت باوند: ""تمكنا من بناء طائرة ستيف وإطلاقها، وهي طائرة تُضاهي طائرة إكس-48، ولكن بجزء بسيط من ميزانية البرنامج وفي تسعة أشهر فقط"". ويعترف بأنه شعر ""بهجوم"" من بعض المستثمرين، عند عرض خطط شركة أوت باوند الثورية عليهم. لكن آرون بويسن، مدير تطوير الأعمال في الشركة ذاتها يقول إن الفريق ""يؤمن إيماناً راسخاً"" بأن الطريقة الوحيدة لتطوير وإطلاق طائرة ركاب ثورية جديدة، مثل أولمبيك، بنجاح، ليست بأن تصبح مثل بوينغ 2.0 أو إيرباص 2.0. ويضيف: ""نحن نشكك في هذا الوضع الراهن. لقد قررنا أننا لكي ننجح في بناء طائرة جديدة تماماً، نحتاج إلى النظر في ما نستعين به من مصادر خارجية وما ندخله في صناعتها"". ولتحقيق هذه الغاية، استخدموا الطباعة ثلاثية الأبعاد المتقدمة لصنع أدواتهم الخاصة، و""إثبات"" قدرتهم على بناء طائرة قابلة للطيران من ألياف الكربون، وكان نموذجهم التجريبي ""أرخص بكثير من أي شركة أخرى""، كما يقول أرمينتا. ويقول سويتمان: ""أعتقد أن هذه مشاريع مُخلصة وجديرة بالثناء. لكن ما أراه في الكثير من هذه المشاريع الجديدة هو نوع من التهويل، وكأنهم يقولون لك: بإمكاننا تحقيق ذلك، نحن جيل جديد. توقف عن السلبية يا جدِّي"". ويضيف: ""بالتأكيد، يمكنك أن تكون متفائلاً، لكن عليك أن تنظر إلى العقبات التي تواجهك، وكم من المال سيتطلب الأمر للحصول على منتج يمكنك تقديمه لشركة طيران، وكيفية تقديمه، ثم كم ستكسب من بيعه"". تعمل شركة ""أوت باوند"" الآن على تحويل ""ستيف"" إلى طائرة بدون طيار من طراز ""غيت واي"" يمكنها بيعها في هذه الأثناء. بعد ذلك، لديها خطط لإصدار نسخة مطورة بطول جناحين مضاعف، وطائرة أعمال طويلة المدى للغاية، والطائرة ""أولمبيك""، بالإضافة إلى طائرة ركاب أكبر حجماً مخطط لها في أربعينيات القرن الحادي والعشرين. لكن ستكون هناك تحديات كثيرة يجب التغلب عليها قبل ذلك. يقول بويسن: ""هناك مجموعة كبيرة من مهندسي الطيران والمديرين والقادة الموهوبين هنا في سياتل (أحد مراكز صناعة الطائرات في الولايات المتحدة)، وهم، بصراحة، متعطشون لكل ما هو جديد، ولهذا السبب نحن هنا""."

BBC,en,arabic_general,"يواجه زهران ممداني تحديات كبيرة في سعيه لتنفيذ أجندته السياسيّة في مدينة نيويورك، قد تتمثل بخفض تمويل مدن ونشر قوات الحرس الوطني وتكثيف مداهمات وكالة الهجرة والجمارك. صدر الصورة،Getty/Reuters بعد لحظات من فوز زهران ممداني بمعركته الانتخابية لمنصب عمدة مدينة نيويورك، ركّز النجم السياسي الصاعد على معركته التالية وهي: مواجهة رئيس الولايات المتحدة. وفي خطاب فوزه يوم الثلاثاء، التفت ممداني إلى الكاميرات ليسخر من الرئيس مباشرة: ""دونالد ترامب، بما أنني أعلم أنك تشاهد، فلديّ أربع كلمات لك: ارفع مستوى صوت تلفازك"". وبعد دقائق، ردّ ترامب على موقعه للتواصل الاجتماعي ""تروث سوشيال"": ""وها قد بدأت!"". وانتقد الرئيس دونالد ترامب الرجل البالغ من العمر 34 عاماً بشدة، ووصفه بأنه يُمثل المستقبل ""الشيوعي"" للحزب الديمقراطي. وكان ترامب قد أيد أندرو كومو، الحاكم الديمقراطي السابق الذي ترشح مستقلاً، وأخبر سكان نيويورك أنهم إذا اختاروا ممداني، فسيقطع التمويل عن المدينة. وفي صباح اليوم التالي لفوز ممداني، حذّر من أن الناس ""سيفرّون"" من نيويورك. وهذه ليست المرة الأولى التي يحاول فيها ترامب، الذي وُلد ونشأ في نيويورك، التدخل في شؤون المدينة، بدءاً من تكثيف حملات تفتيش الهجرة وصولاً إلى محاولة إلغاء تمويل رسوم الازدحام، وهي سياسة يعارضها. لكن ممداني يبدو هادئاً، حيث قال خلال خطاب النصر الذي ألقاه: ""إذا كان هناك ما يستطيع أن يبيّن لأمةٍ خانها دونالد ترامب كيفية هزيمته، فهي المدينة التي أوجدته"". ومنذ توليه منصبه، مارس ترامب سلطته الفيدرالية ضد العديد من المدن التي يديرها الديمقراطيون، فأرسل قوات الحرس الوطني، وشنّ حملة صارمة على الهجرة في جميع أنحاء الولايات المتحدة. كما خفض تمويل مدن بمليارات الدولارات منذ إغلاق الحكومة في الأول من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بما في ذلك مدينة نيويورك، حيث جمّد 18 مليار دولار من الأموال الفيدرالية المخصصة لمشاريع البنية التحتية الكبرى. وقال خبراء سياسيون لبي بي سي إن ترامب قد يُخفّض الإنفاق بسهولة، ما قد يُعيق وعود ممداني الانتخابية بخفض تكاليف المعيشة. وكان ممداني الذي يصف نفسه بـ""الاشتراكي الديمقراطي""، قد دعا في حملته الانتخابية إلى توفير حافلات مجانية وأسرع، وتجميد الإيجارات في المساكن الخاضعة لضبط الإيجار، وتوفير رعاية أطفال شاملة، ومتاجر بقالة تُديرها المدينة، إضافة إلى أهداف سياسية أخرى. وقال جوليان زيليزر، أستاذ التاريخ بجامعة برينستون: ""في الواقع، سيُضطر العمدة المنتخب إلى تركيز اهتمامه بشكل كبير على الرئيس ترامب والهجمات على نيويورك، بدلاً من جميع القضايا التي يرغب في معالجتها"". وأضاف: ""ستُمثل هذه مشكلة للمدينة، كما ستُمثل مشكلة وتحدياً للعمدة المنتخب في الحفاظ على تركيزه"". ولم يُجب ممداني على طلب بي بي سي للتعليق. ويقول خبراء السياسة إن ممداني، العضو السابق في جمعية ولاية نيويورك، يواجه تحديات عدة إلى جانب ترامب، لتحقيق أهدافه السياسية الطموحة. وقد أشار إلى أنه يستطيع جمع 10 مليارات دولار من الإيرادات من خلال زيادة الضرائب على الشركات الثرية وبارتفاع واحد في المئة على أصحاب الدخول في نيويورك، لكن ذلك يتطلب موافقة حاكم الولاية. وحتى الآن، ترددت الحاكمة الديمقراطية كاثي هوشول، التي تواجه منافسة شرسة لإعادة انتخابها العام المقبل، في دعم خطة ممداني الضريبية. وأعلنت إليز ستيفانيك، حليفة ترامب، أنها ستسعى للحصول على ترشيح الحزب الجمهوري لأعلى منصب في الولاية. وقد يُحدث ترامب ثغرات إضافية في هذه الخطط إذا خفض المزيد من التمويل الفيدرالي، الذي بلغ العام الماضي نحو 8.5 مليار دولار، أي ما يعادل 7 في المئة من إجمالي ميزانية المدينة. وقال زيليزر: ""ستكون هناك مشكلة مالية تحول دون تنفيذ أي مشروع في المدينة. وإذا بدأت الأموال الفيدرالية بالنضوب، فسيُصعّب ذلك تنفيذ أي مشروع جديد"". صدر الصورة،Getty Images وتُستخدم هذه الأموال في مجموعة من الخدمات، بما في ذلك وزارة الإسكان، والاستجابة لحالات الطوارئ، وخدمات الأطفال، بالإضافة إلى صناديق التعليم للطلاب ذوي الدخل المنخفض، ووجبات المدارس، وفقاً لمكتب الميزانية المستقل لمدينة نيويورك. ولم يُحدد ترامب أي الأموال الفيدرالية سيستهدفها. وتقول سارة باركر، مسؤولة الأبحاث والاستراتيجيات العليا في مكتب الميزانية المستقلة لمدينة نيويورك، إن المدينة مُلزمة قانوناً بتوفير بعض هذه الخدمات، مثل تمويل ملاجئ المشردين. وهذا يعني أنه بدون التمويل الفيدرالي، ستضطر حكومة المدينة والولاية إلى تعويض الفرق، مما سيُشكّل ضغطًا على برامج أخرى. وأضافت: ""هناك العديد من خطط الطوارئ التي تُوضع على مستوى المدينة والولاية لمواجهة العديد من السيناريوهات"". بدوره، قال جاستن دي بينيديكتيس-كيسنر، أستاذ السياسات العامة في كلية كينيدي للإدارة الحكومية بجامعة هارفارد، إن ترامب سيواجه على الأرجح تحديات قانونية لحجبه الأموال التي وافق عليها الكونغرس، والتي تشمل المساعدات الغذائية. وأضاف: ""لكن هذا يُبطئ عملية إيصال هذه الأموال إلى مستحقيها"". صدر الصورة،Getty Images واستخدم ترامب أيضاً تهديد إنفاذ القانون ضد المدن التي يقودها الديمقراطيون. فقد نشر قوات الحرس الوطني في مدن مختلفة، بما فيها لوس أنجلوس وبورتلاند وأوريغون وواشنطن العاصمة، واصفاً هذه المدن بأنها مناطق موبوءة بالجريمة وتحتاج إلى تدخل فيدرالي. وحتى الآن، امتنع عن إرسال القوات إلى أكبر مدينة أمريكية، لكن خبراء سياسيين قالوا إن ذلك قد يتغير. وقال زيليزر: ""لديه الوصفة اللازمة بالفعل. ومن الصعب تخيل عدم حدوث ذلك"". وأكد ممداني أنه سيلجأ إلى الطعون القانونية للرد على نشر الحرس الوطني في نيويورك، كما فعلت ولايات أخرى. ولا تزال العديد من القضايا عالقة، وتشق طريقها عبر المحاكم. ويتوقع الخبراء السياسيون أيضاً أن يُوسّع ترامب نطاق حملته على الهجرة في نيويورك، التي لطالما كانت ملاذاً آمناً منذ ثمانينيات القرن الماضي. وهذا يعني أن المدينة ستتعاون مع سلطات الهجرة الفيدرالية. وعززت إدارة ترامب بالفعل إجراءات إنفاذ القانون في محاكم الهجرة بالمدينة، حيث ألقى عناصر إدارة الهجرة والجمارك الأمريكية (ICE) القبض على مئات الأشخاص الوافدين لحضور جلسات استماع إلزامية بشأن الهجرة. وقد تعاونت العمدة الحالي إريك آدامز بشكل كبير مع الإدارة الحالية. لكن ممداني، الذي قدم إلى الولايات المتحدة من أوغندا عندما كان في السابعة من عمره، أشار إلى مسار مختلف. وقال إن نيويورك ستبقى ""مدينة للمهاجرين، بناها المهاجرون، ويحركها المهاجرون، واعتباراً من هذه الليلة، يقودها مهاجر"". وأضاف عشية انتخابه: ""اسمعني أيها الرئيس ترامب عندما أقول هذا: للوصول إلى أيٍّ منا، عليك أن تتجاوزنا جميعاً"". وجاء تعاون آدامز مع إدارة ترامب، بعد أن أسقطت وزارة العدل الأمريكية تهم الرشوة والاحتيال الفيدرالية الموجهة إليه، في خطوة أدّت إلى استقالة المدعي العام الأعلى في نيويورك، الذي زعم أن محامي آدامز طلبوا من مسؤولي وزارة العدل إسقاط القضية مقابل تطبيق سياسات ترامب المتعلقة بالهجرة. صدر الصورة،Getty Images ومن المرجّح أن يستغرق ممداني بعض الوقت لوضع استراتيجية للرد على خطوات ترامب الأولى، إذ لن يتولى منصبه حتى يناير/ كانون الثاني القادم، وفقاً لبوب شابيرو، أستاذ العلوم السياسية في جامعة كولومبيا. واتخذ قادة مدن ديمقراطيون آخرون نهجاً متنوعاً لمواجهة ترامب، بمن فيهم عمدة بوسطن التقدمية ميشيل وو، التي عارضت الرئيس مراراً. حيث هدّد ترامب ذات مرة بسحب مباريات كأس العالم من مدينتها ماساتشوستس. وفي سان فرانسيسكو، أفادت التقارير أن عمدة المدينة، دانيال لوري، اعتمد على قادة قطاع التكنولوجيا لثني ترامب عن إرسال قوات الحرس الوطني إلى المدينة، بحجة أن ذلك سيؤثر على الاقتصاد. وقال شابيرو إن ممداني قد يتخذ خطوات مماثلة في نيويورك لتجنب القوات الفيدرالية، مستعيناً بقادة وول ستريت من مدينة صنع فيها ترامب مسيرته المهنية في مجال العقارات. وفي وثيقة سياسية حول ""تحصين مدينة نيويورك من ترامب""، صرّح العمدة المنتخب بأنه يعتزم توظيف 200 محامٍ إضافي لتعزيز الإدارة القانونية في المدينة لمواجهة ""التجاوزات الرئاسية"" لإدارة ترامب. ويواجه ممداني تحديات كبيرة في سعيه لتنفيذ أجندته السياسية الطموحة، لذا قد يختار معاركه مع الرئيس لحشد الدعم بين سكان نيويورك المناهضين لترامب لسياسات معينة، وفقاً لما قاله دي بينيديكتيس-كيسنر. وأضاف ""أعتقد أنه سيتواصل مع ترامب إذا ساعده ذلك على تحقيق أهدافه السياسية. لكنه سياسي ذكي بما يكفي ولن يفعل ذلك إلا إذا كان ذلك ممكناً""."
